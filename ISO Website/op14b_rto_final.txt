I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Reactive capability (NX-12D) data defines and represents the physical characteristics and ratings of a 
reactive device, including (but not limited to): Generators (as defined in ISO New England Operating 
Procedure No. 14 – Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset 
Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14) ), Dispatchable Asset 
Related Demands (DARDs), or other dynamic reactive devices (e.g., synchronous condensers or flexible 
alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) devices) and is required by ISO New England (ISO) 
and the Local Control Centers (LCCs) in order to develop accurate system models and to support the 
reliable operation of the New England Transmission System.  Each Market Participant (MP) is required to 
provide this data through the ISO NX submittal software as described in this Appendix B to OP-14 (OP-
14B). 
 
NX-12D data is required for each device that is located in the New England Reliability Coordinator Area 
(RCA) and is either  
i) part of a Generator, including generating facilities consisting of multiple generating units, where that 
Generator has a total real power capability of at least 1 MW, 
ii) part of a DARD that is contained within an Electric Storage Facility (ESF DARD),  
iii) A shunt-connected dynamic reactive power device (e.g.., Static VAR Compensator (SVC), or 
Synchronous Condenser), or  
iv)  is another type of dynamic reactive device for which ISO or the LCC requires and specifically 
requests reactive capability data.   
The MP may submit one set of representative reactive capability data, including the number of devices 
installed, for electricity producing or consuming devices that: 
i) use an inverter (e.g., photovoltaic, wind, etc.),  
ii) are associated with the same Resource, DARD or other piece of dynamic reactive equipment; and, 
iii) have the same Point of Interconnection.   
 
NX-12D data may be required by ISO and the LCC for other dynamic reactive devices that support the 
reliable operation of the New England Transmission System.  Because the capabilities of these devices 
may not match the descriptions in this OP-14B, ISO, the LCC, and the MP will work together to 
determine how to accurately represent the reactive capability of these devices through the NX submittal 
software. 
 
The manufacturer nameplate lagging and leading reactive power (MVAr) output capability is based on 
the design parameters of the equipment.  This capability represents the theoretical maximum reactive 
capability of a specific reactive device. 
 
The manufacturer nameplate operating lagging and leading MVAr output capability may be limited during 
normal operation by any one of several devices or considerations other than the manufacturer nameplate 
capability curve.  Examples of limiting devices include, but are not limited to, excitation limiters, electrical 
protection relaying, and thermal protection relaying.  Examples of limiting considerations include, but are 
not limited to, internal station voltage requirements, auxiliary equipment constraints, resource 
interconnection generator step-up transformer (GSU) overheating, fuel or prime mover limitations, and 
contractual arrangements.  When any such limitations are present, the equipment cannot operate at the 
manufacturer nameplate reactive capability.  This restricted capability represents the normal reactive 
operating capability and, accordingly, it shall be included in the NX-12D data. 
 
The MP shall report any change in the reactive capability of a device in Real-Time to ISO and the 
appropriate LCC control room.  If it is determined that the change will last longer than six (6) months, 
then the MP shall update NX-12D data in the NX submittal software. 
 
The MP shall verify all NX-12D data is accurate upon submittal and at least annually.  ISO shall initiate, 
and the MP shall respond to, the annual NX-12D data verification, which shall be performed through the 
NX submittal software.

II. DATA SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
  The MP shall submit NX-12D data through ISO NX submittal software under the following conditions: 
1. Prior to ISO designating a Resource or ESF DARD as being ready to follow dispatch; 
2. Prior to a dynamic reactive device being placed in service; 
3.  No later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date when a determination is made by ISO or the MP 
that the data contained in the NX submittal software is inaccurate; or, 
4. No later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of determination that a temporary modification to 
a Reactive Resource with NX-12D data, that affects that Reactive Resource’s reactive capability, will be 
in effect for longer than six (6) months. 
Synchronous Generator Assets or ESF DARDs that are comprised of multiple individual machines require 
a separate NX-12D form for each machine and a separate NX-12D form for the composite Reactive 
Resource.   
Non-Synchronous Generator Assets or ESF DARDs that are comprised of multiple individual pieces of 
dynamic reactive equipment require a separate NX-12D form for each equipment type at the asset. 
Reactive devices with multiple types of reactive equipment require a separate NX-12D form for the 
composite asset. For example, a wind plant that is comprised of twenty-five (25) turbines from one (1) 
manufacturer and twenty-five (25) turbines from another manufacturer would require two (2) separate NX-
12D forms (one for each unique machine type) and an additional NX-12D form that captures the entire 
plant composite reactive power capability.  
  
 III. DATA DETERMINATION FOR SUBMITTAL 
 A. Prerequisites for filling out the NX-12D form 
 The following are required in order for the MP to provide accurate data on the NX-12D form: 
1. 
Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.  This curve is also referred to as the P/Q or 
MW/MVAr curve. This curve is provided by the manufacturer of the reactive equipment and is a graphic 
illustration of the reactive capability of a machine as a function of real power output or consumption.  It 
represents the physical limitations of that machine based upon design parameters.  This curve shall be 
uploaded to the application using the File Attachments tab.  NOTE: If this curve is not available because 
the manufacturer is out of business or other similar circumstance, the curve shall be created by the MP 
using the best possible data for the resource capability. 
 
2. 
Reactive Capability curve showing any limitations to the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This 
curve is referred to as the Normal Operating curve.  These limitations can include, but are not limited to: 
under-/over-excitation, prime mover (maximum MW limit), and procedural limitations.  This may be 
provided by the manufacturer or may need to be created by the MP using all of the known limitations 
overlaid onto the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This curve shall be uploaded to the 
application using the File Attachments tab. 
 
3. 
Voltage schedule or automatic voltage regulator exemption as provided by the Transmission 
Operator. 
 B. Theoretical and Tested Values 
 The Theoretical and Tested Values section of the NX-12D data form is where MPs provide reactive 
capability data that has been derived from the Nameplate Reactive Capability and Normal Operating 
curves in order to discretely model those curves in ISO systems.  In order to determine these discrete data 
points, MW values are determined based upon manufacturer maximum MW value, minimum MW value,

and certain other MW values that may be present on a given reactive capability curve.  The MVAr values 
that correspond to these MW values are then determined either graphically or mathematically from the 
reactive capability curves. 
 These capability values represent gross reactive (MVAr) and real (MW) power as measured at the 
equipment terminal prior to station service load.   
 Lagging (over-excited) capability is defined as the Resource providing reactive power to the electrical 
system and is denoted as a positive value.   
 Leading (under-excited) capability is defined as the Resource absorbing reactive power from the 
electrical system and is denoted as a negative value.

 NOTE: Synchronous machines are considered any rotating machine that is electrically coupled to the 
electrical system through an electrical generator.  
 
The “Identical Unit Count” field shall be equal to “0” unless otherwise directed by ISO.  
 
a. Nameplate Reactive Capability Data Determination 
The Nameplate Reactive Capability curve is provided by the manufacturer based upon design 
specifications of the equipment.   Figure 2 illustrates a typical Nameplate Reactive Capability curve for a 
sample synchronous machine at various hydrogen pressures when not encumbered by any protective or 
limiting concerns.  The sample synchronous machine is designed to operate at thirty (30) PSIA hydrogen 
pressure.  For equipment nameplate capability, the requested data consists of MW and MVAr pairs for 
nine (9) points along the capability curve (see, Figure 2).

NOTE 
Some manufacturers provide a curve with lagging (over-excited) and leading (under-excited) axes 
reversed (i.e. leading will be on the positive y-axis and lagging will be on the negative y-axis). 
 
(1) Nameplate Real Power Data Values 
i. General Instructions 
 (a) 
These MW values are the same regardless of whether the MP is determining reactive power 
capability for Nameplate Reactive Capability or Normal Operating Curves.  
 
(b)  These MW values will be N/A on data for the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach that 
MW value on the Normal Operating curve.  
 An example of this is a machine that is capable of twenty (20) MVA but limited by the prime mover 
capability of ten (10) MW.  In this case, the machine cannot produce enough real power in order to 
reach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Points on the Normal Operating 
curve.   
 
(c)  If there are multiple temperature-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves for the machine output, 
the curve that most closely approximates forty (40) degrees Celsius (40oC) shall be used to determine 
reactive capability.

(d) 
If there are multiple voltage-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves, the curve for 1.0 per unit 
(p.u.) shall be used. 
 
 
(e)  Motoring Capability and Full Pumping Capability MW values shall be N/A (if the Resource is part of a 
storage facility, the reactive capability while consuming will be reported on a separate NX-12D form). 
 
ii. Nameplate Real Power Data Point Determination 
 
(a)  Determine the Minimum Manual Load Point MW (see, Points 1 and 6 on Figure 2). This value: 
 is the lowest MW output at which the machine can produce both real and reactive power;   
 is a manufacturer-provided value;  
 shall be the lower of the summer and winter values if there are separate values; and 
 if modified, changes the values of the Intermediate and Three Quarter Load Points. 
 
(b)  Determine the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point MW (see, Point 5 on Figure 2).  This 
value is the: 
 maximum real power capability of the machine at unity power factor, not taking into account any 
limitations such as prime mover capability;    
 point where the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve crosses the zero (0) MVAr point; and  
 if modified, changes the values of the Intermediate and Three Quarter Load Points. 
 
(c)  Determine the Intermediate Load Point MW (see, Points 2 and 7 on Figure 2).  This is a calculated 
value that is halfway between the Minimum Manual Load Point and the Unity Generating Unit Power 
Factor Load Point and is determined by the equation: 
𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 𝑀𝑊
= 0.5 ∗(𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡−𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) + 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 
 This point is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the 
machine cannot reach the MW value in normal operation. 
 This point will change if the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point or the Minimum Manual 
Load Point are changed. 
 
(d)  Determine the Three Quarter Load Point MW (see, Points 3 and 8 on Figure 2).  This is a calculated 
value that is seventy-five percent (75%) between the Minimum Manual Load Point and the Unity 
Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point and is determined by  the equation: 
𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑒 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 𝑀𝑊
= 0.75 ∗(𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡−𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) + 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 
 This point is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the 
machine cannot reach the MW value in normal operation. 
 This point will change if the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point or the Minimum Manual 
Load Point are changed. 
 
(e)  Determine Lagging Break Point Load MW (See Point 4 Figure 2).  This value: 
 is determined by examining the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.  
 Is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of the curve where 
there is an intersection between the curve sections reflecting the field winding limit and stator design 
limit;

 may be a different value than the Leading Break Point Load MW value;   
 is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve data if there is no break point in the curve; and   
 is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the machine cannot 
reach the MW value in normal operation. 
 
(f) 
Determine Leading Break Point Load MW (See Point 9 Figure 2).  This value: 
 
 is determined by examining the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve; 
 is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the leading (under-excited) portion of the curve 
where there is an intersection between the curve sections reflecting the stator design limit and the end 
region heating limit;   
 may be a different value than the Lagging Break Point Load MW value; 
 is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve data if there is no break point in the curve; and 
 is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the machine cannot 
reach the MW value in normal operation. 
 
The Transitional Load Point MW values are determined by overlaying any limitations (e.g. over-/under-
excitation limiters or turbine max power limits) on the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.  This 
combined curve is referred to as the Normal Operating curve for the machine.  Figure 3 illustrates a typical 
Normal Operating curve for a sample synchronous generating unit at various hydrogen pressures when 
that machine is limited by protective relaying or limiting concerns.  The sample generating unit is designed 
to operate at a thirty (30) PSIA hydrogen pressure level.

 is determined by examining the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve; 
 is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of the curve where 
the most limiting limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;

 is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve if there is no limitation or that limitation does not 
intersect with the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve; and 
 is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited such that the machine cannot 
reach the MW value where the limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.

 may be a different value than the Lagging Transitional Load Point MW value;  
 is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve if there is no limitation or that limitation does not 
intersect with the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve; and   
 is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW-limited, such that the machine cannot 
reach the MW value where the limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. 
 
 (2) Nameplate Reactive Power Data Point Determination

limit), procedural, etc.) on the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.   
 
(b) The reactive power values may differ between Nameplate Reactive Capability curve values and 
Normal Operating Curve values depending upon any machine limitations.  The absolute value of the 
Normal Operating curve MVAr values cannot be greater than the absolute value of the Nameplate 
Reactive Capability curve MVAr values. 
 
(c)  These reactive power values will be N/A on the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach 
the MW value on the Normal Operating curve.  An example of this is a machine that is capable of twenty 
(20) MVA but limited by the prime mover capability of ten (10) MW.  In this case, the machine cannot 
produce enough MW in order to reach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load 
Points.   
 
(d)  If there are multiple temperature-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves for the machine output, 
the curve that most closely approximates 40 degrees Celsius (40oC) shall be used to determine reactive 
capability. 
 
(e)  If there are multiple gas pressure curves, the curve that represents the machine’s normal operating 
pressure shall be used. 
 
(f)  All values shall be in MW or MVAr.  If the curve provided by the manufacturer is not in MW or MVAr, 
these values shall be converted by the MP. 
 
(g) Motoring Capability and Full Pumping Capability MVAr values shall be N/A.   
 
ii.  Nameplate Lagging Reactive Power Value Determination 
 
 
(a) Determine the Lagging Minimum Manual Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-
excited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Minimum Manual 
Load Point MW value. 
 
(b) Determine the Lagging Intermediate Load Point MVAr.  This is the point on the lagging (over-excited)

MW value. 
 
(d) Determine Lagging Break Point Load MVAr.  This is the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of 
the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Lagging Break Point Load MW value. 
This point is N/A if there is no break point in the curve.

excited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Minimum Manual 
Load Point MW value.

excited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Intermediate Load 
Point MW value.

excited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Three Quarter Load 
Point MW value.

of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Leading Break Point Load MW value. 
This point is N/A if there is no break point in the curve.  
 
(e) Determine Leading Transitional Load Point MVAr.  This is the point on the leading (under-excited) 
portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Leading Transitional Load 
Point MW value. This point is N/A if there is no limitation or that limitation does not intersect with the 
nameplate curve. 
 
b. Normal Operating Capability Data Point Determination 
(1)  Normal Operating Capability Real Power Values 
(a) These MW values are the same regardless of whether the MP is determining reactive power capability 
for either the Nameplate or Normal Operating curves.  
(b) These MW values will be N/A on data for the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach that 
MW value on the Normal Operating curve.  
 An example of this is a machine that is capable of 20 MVA but limited by the prime mover capability of

 (2) Normal Operating Capability Reactive Power Data Determination  
These values shall reflect any limitations (under-/over-excitation, prime mover (max P limit), procedural, 
etc.) that restrict the machine MVAr or MW capability to less than the Nameplate Reactive Capability 
curve.   
 
(a) The reactive power values may differ between the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve values and 
Normal Operating curve values depending upon any machine limitations.  The absolute value of the

Reactive Capability curve MVAr values. 
 
(b)  These reactive power values will be N/A on the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach 
the MW value on the Normal Operating curve.   An example of this is a machine that is capable of 20 
MVA but limited by the prime mover capability of 10 MW.  In this case, the machine cannot produce 
enough MW in order to reach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Points.

the curve that most closely approximates forty (40) degrees Celsius (40oC) shall be used to determine 
reactive capability. 
 
(d) If there are multiple gas pressure curves, the curve that represents the machine’s normal operating 
pressure shall be used. 
 
(e)  All values shall be in MW or MVAr.  If the curve provided by the manufacturer is not in MW or MVAr, 
these values shall be converted by the MP.

excited) portion of the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Minimum 
Manual Load Point MW value. 
 
(b) Determine the Lagging Intermediate Load Point MVAr.  This is the point on the lagging (over-excited) 
portion of the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Intermediate Load 
Point MW value. 
 
(c) Determine the Lagging Three Quarter Load Point MVAr.  This is the point on the lagging (over-excited) 
portion of the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Three Quarter Load 
Point MW value. This point is N/A if the machine is MW limited and cannot reach the Three Quarter Load 
Point MW value in normal operation. 
 
(d) Determine Lagging Break Point Load MVAr.  This is the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of 
the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Lagging Break Point Load MW

2. Non-Synchronous Machines That Produce Real Power and non-Pump DARDs 
 
 
 
 
NOTE: Non-Synchronous machines are any machine that is electrically coupled to the electrical system 
through power electronics.  These machines include, but are not limited to, inverter-based resources. 
 
The “Identical Unit Count” field shall be equal to the number of identical power producing pieces of equipment 
at the asset.  For example: a wind plant with ten (10) turbines would have “10” in the “Identical Unit Count” field 
or a solar plant with one thousand (1000) inverters would have “1000” in the “Identical Unit Count” field.  
 
a. Nameplate Reactive Capability Data Point Determination 
The Nameplate Reactive Capability curve is provided by the manufacturer based upon design specifications of 
the equipment.   Figure 3 illustrates a Nameplate Reactive Capability curve for a sample non-synchronous 
machine. A specific reactive capability curve for a non-synchronous machine may look different than the 
example curve in Figure 3; however, the concepts for determining the MW and MVAr points are similar for all 
types of curves. For equipment reactive power capability, the requested data consists of MW and MVAr pairs 
for eleven points along the capability curve (see, Figure 3).

(a)  These values are the same regardless of whether the MP is determining reactive power capability for   
Nameplate or Normal Operating curves.  
 
(b) These MW values are N/A on data for the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach the MW 
value on the Normal Operating curve. An example of this is a machine that is capable of twenty (20) MVA but 
limited by the prime mover (e.g., solar panel, battery) capability of ten (10) MW.  In this case, the machine 
cannot produce enough MW in order to reach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load 
Points.

Interconnection, the transformer at the Point of Interconnection for these Resources is the equivalent of 
a GSU for conventional generators. 
For wind, solar, or other plants that have geographically diverse generating or consuming pieces of 
equipment with the same Point of Interconnection, the terminal voltage is the voltage at the terminals of 
the generating or consuming equipment before any transformer/transformation to a different voltage 
level (e.g., between a turbine and its GSU or between a solar inverter and the collector transformer). 
For Option A units, the maximum and minimum acceptable voltage schedule limits will typically differ 
from the more narrow voltage schedule tolerance bands as stated in ISO New England Operating 
Procedure No. 12 - Voltage and Reactive Control (OP-12), Appendix B - Voltage & Reactive Schedules 
(OP-12B). 
The ISO or the LCC may operate the station at more restrictive voltages due to transmission equipment 
voltage limits.

a. General Instructions 
i. The On-Peak schedule field is used for the default schedule, and the Off-Peak schedule field is 
used for alternate schedules.  In the event that the asset is not provided an alternate schedule, 
the default schedule shall be entered into the Off-Peak schedule fields. 
 
b. Reactive Resources that have been identified as “Option A” on the most recent ISO New England 
Operating Procedure No. 12 (OP-12) Appendix D-Voltage Schedule Annual Transmittal Form (OP-
12D): 
 
Figure - 4 Voltage schedule data required for Option A Reactive Resources 
 
(1) 
Select voltage control “Option A”. 
 
(2) 
Enter the maximum and minimum acceptable voltage limits.  These limits shall reflect 
restrictions on generator-owned equipment, including but not limited to: terminal voltage 
constraints, auxiliary equipment limitations, station service requirements, GSU, or breaker 
ratings. 
 
(3) 
Enter the tolerance band high, voltage schedule, and tolerance band low values.  For 
existing assets, these values are provided by the LCC on OP-12D.  For new assets, these 
values are communicated by ISO-NE. 
 
(4) 
Enter the terminal bus voltage maximum and minimum limits as determined by generator-
owned equipment limitations. 
(5) 
Enter the voltage schedule as reflected on the terminal bus in the terminal bus schedule. 
 
(6) 
If the asset does not have High Side Visibility: 
 
i.  Enter a detailed description of the method used to monitor GSU high side voltage in the 
voltage control option comments or as a separate attached document.  If the description is 
provided as a separate file, enter a reference to the file in the voltage control option comments. 
 
 
c. Reactive Resources that have been identified as “Option B” on the most recent OP-12D transmittal 
form:

Figure - 5 Voltage schedule data required for Option B Reactive Resources 
 
(1) 
Select Voltage Control “Option B”. 
 
(2) 
Enter the maximum, voltage schedule, and minimum values.  For existing assets, these 
values are provided by the LCC on OP-12 D.  For new assets, these values are communicated by 
the interconnecting entity. 
 
(3) 
Enter the terminal bus voltage maximum and minimum limits as determined by generator-
owned equipment limitations. 
(4) 
Enter the voltage schedule as reflected on the terminal bus in the terminal bus schedule. 
 
(5) 
If the asset does not have High Side Visibility: 
 
i. Enter a detailed description of the method used to monitor GSU high side voltage in the voltage 
control option comments or as a separate attached document.  If the description is provided as a 
separate file, enter a reference to the file in the voltage control option comments. 
 
d. Reactive Resources that have requested and been identified by ISO as “Option C”, as described in 
ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 12 – Voltage and Reactive Control, are exempted from 
providing automatic voltage control:  
 
Figure - 6 Voltage control comments required for Option C Reactive Resources 
 
 
(1) 
Select voltage control “Option C”. 
 
(2) 
Enter a description of the asset reactive controls and operation in lieu of maintaining a 
voltage schedule through use of AVR or its equivalent. This description can be entered in the 
voltage control option comments field or uploaded as a separate file. If the description is provided 
as a separate file, enter a reference to the file in the voltage control option comments. 
 
5. Operation of Automatic Voltage Regulating Equipment (AVR) 
 
OP-12 and NERC Reliability Standard VAR-002 - Generator Operation for Maintaining Network Voltage 
Schedules require each generator equipped with an AVR to operate with the AVR in-service in the 
automatic voltage control mode and controlling voltage and to notify ISO and the applicable LCC of any 
AVR status changes.  The MP shall indicate when the AVR will automatically control voltage during start-
up, normal operation, and shut-down.  When such conditions occur that match the conditions indicated 
on Form NX-12D, this serves as advance standing notification to ISO and the LCC, and Real-Time

reporting is not required. 
Shunt-connected dynamic reactive power devices shall provide indication of AVR status during start-up 
(if applicable), normal operation, and shut-down (if applicable).  
 
6. Plant Voltage Control Document  
 
For all Reactive Resources that employ an overall plant voltage control scheme (including but not limited 
to wind plant controllers and combined-cycle distributed control systems), the MP shall upload a file 
containing a detailed explanation of the voltage control scheme into the NX submittal software on the 
File Attachments Tab. 
 
7. Power System Stabilizer  
Figure 7 – Power System Stabilizer Information 
 
a. The MP shall check the PSS Installed checkbox if the machine has a PSS installed, regardless of the 
status of that PSS (e.g., a machine that has a PSS installed, but the PSS was never commissioned 
would still indicate that a PSS is installed). 
b. The MP shall check the PSS Normally in Service checkbox if the PSS is on and functional when the 
machine is producing or absorbing power.  The required PSS status will be indicated in the System 
Impact Study. 
 
NOTE 
If the PSS Normally in Service box is checked, then the PSS Installed box shall also be 
checked.  
 
8. Short-Term Overload Capability 
Reactive Resources that have a short-term overload capability shall provide a document, on the attachments 
tab, describing the operation, capability, and duration of the overload capability.
