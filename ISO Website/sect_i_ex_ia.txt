ISO NEW ENGLAND FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY 
Overview  
The procedures and requirements set forth in this ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy shall 
govern all Applicants, all Market Participants and all Non-Market Participant Transmission Customers.  
Capitalized terms used in the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy shall have the meaning 
specified in Section I.   
 
The purpose of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy is (i) to establish minimum criteria for 
participation in the New England Markets; (ii) to establish a financial assurance policy for Market 
Participants and Non-Market Participant Transmission Customers that includes commercially reasonable 
credit review procedures to assess the financial ability of an Applicant, a Market Participant or a Non-
Market Participant Transmission Customer to pay for service transactions under the Tariff and to pay its 
share of the ISO expenses, including amounts under Section IV of the Tariff, and including any applicable 
Participant Expenses; (iii) to set forth the requirements for alternative forms of security that will be 
deemed acceptable to the ISO and consistent with commercial practices established by the Uniform 
Commercial Code that protect the ISO and the Market Participants against the risk of non-payment by 
other, defaulting Market Participants or by Non-Market Participant Transmission Customers; (iv) to set 
forth the conditions under which the ISO will conduct business in a nondiscriminatory way so as to avoid 
the possibility of failure of payment for services rendered under the Tariff; and (v) to collect amounts past 
due, to collect amounts payable upon billing adjustments, to make up shortfalls in payments, to suspend 
Market Participants and Non-Market Participant Transmission Customers that fail to comply with the 
terms of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, to terminate the membership of defaulting 
Market Participants and to terminate service to defaulting Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Customers.  
 
I.  
GROUPS REGARDED AS SINGLE MARKET PARTICIPANTS  
In the case of a group of Entities that are treated as a single Market Participant pursuant to Section 4.1 of 
the Second Restated NEPOOL Agreement (the “RNA”), the group members shall be deemed to have 
elected to be jointly and severally liable for all debts to Market Participants, PTOs, Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customers, NEPOOL and the ISO of any of the group members.  For  
the purposes of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, the term “Market Participant” shall, in 
the case of a group of members that are treated as a single Market Participant pursuant to Section 4.1 of 
the RNA, be deemed to refer to the group of members as a whole, and any financial assurance provided 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy will be credited to the account of the group 
member with the customer identification at the ISO.  
 
II.  
MARKET PARTICIPANTS’ REVIEW AND CREDIT LIMITS  
Solely for purposes of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy: a “Municipal Market 
Participant” is any Market Participant that is either (a) a Publicly Owned Entity except for an electric 
cooperative or an organization including one or more electric cooperatives as used in Section 1 of the 
RNA or (b) a municipality, an agency thereof, a body politic or a public corporation (i) that is created 
under the authority of any state or province that is adjacent to one of the New England states, (ii) that is 
authorized to own, lease and operate electric generation, transmission or distribution facilities and (iii) 
that has been approved for treatment as a Municipal Market Participant by the ISO after consultation with 
the NEPOOL Budget and Finance Subcommittee. Market Participants that are not Municipal Market 
Participants are referred to as “Non-Municipal Market Participants.” 
 
A. 
Minimum Criteria for Market Participation 
Any entity participating or seeking to participate in the New England Markets shall 
comply with the requirements of this Section II.A.  For purposes of this Section II.A, the 
term “customer” shall refer to both Market Participants and Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customers and the word “applicant” shall refer to both applicants for 
Market Participant status and applicants for transmission service from the ISO. 
 
1. 
Information Disclosure 
 
(a) 
Each customer and applicant, on an annual basis (by April 30 each year) shall submit a 
completed information form in the form of (with only minor, non-material changes) and 
with the information required by Attachment 6 to the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy.  Customer or applicant shall not be required to disclose information 
required by Attachment 6 if such disclosure is prohibited by law; provided, however, if 
the disclosure of any information required by Attachment 6 is prohibited by law, then 
customer or applicant shall use reasonable efforts to obtain permission to make such 
disclosure. This information shall be treated as Confidential Information, but its 
disclosure pursuant to subsection (b) below is expressly permitted in accordance with the 
terms of the ISO New England Information Policy.  Customers and applicants may 
satisfy the requirements above by providing the ISO with filings made to the Securities 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
and Exchange Commission or other similar regulatory agencies that include substantially 
similar information to that required above, provided, however, that the customer or 
applicant must clearly indicate where the specific information is located in those filings.  
An applicant that fails to provide this information will be prohibited from participating in 
the New England Markets until the deficiency is rectified.  If a customer fails to provide 
this information by end of business on April 30, then the ISO shall issue a notice of such 
failure to the customer on the next Business Day and, if the customer does not provide 
the information to the ISO within 5 Business Days after issuance of such notice, then the 
customer will be suspended as described in Section III.B.3 of the ISO New England 
Financial Assurance Policy until the deficiency is rectified.  
 
(b) 
The ISO will review the information provided pursuant to subsection (a) above, and will 
also review whether the customer or applicant or any of the Principals of the customer or 
applicant are included on any relevant list maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset 
Control.  If, after review of the information provided pursuant to subsection (a) above or 
any other information disclosed pursuant to this Section II, the ISO in its sole discretion 
requires additional information to make its analysis under this subsection (b), the ISO 
may require additional information from the customer or applicant.  If, based on these 
reviews, the ISO determines that the commencement or continued participation of such 
customer or applicant in the New England Markets may present an unreasonable risk to 
those markets or its Market Participants, the Chief Financial Officer of the ISO shall 
promptly forward to the Participants Committee or its delegate, for its input, such 
concerns, together with such background materials deemed by the ISO to be necessary 
for the Participants Committee or its delegate to develop an informed opinion with 
respect to the identified concerns, including any measures that the ISO may recommend 
imposing as a condition to the commencement or continued participation in the markets 
by such customer or applicant (including suspension) or the ISO’s recommendation to 
prohibit or terminate participation by the customer or applicant in the New England 
Markets.  The ISO shall consider the input of the Participants Committee or its delegate 
before taking any action to address the identified concerns.  If the ISO chooses to impose 
measures other than prohibition (in the case of an applicant) or termination (in the case of 
a customer) of participation in the New England Markets, then the ISO shall be required 
to make an informational filing with the Commission as soon as reasonably practicable 
after taking such action.  If the ISO chooses to prohibit (in the case of an applicant) or 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
terminate (in the case of a customer) participation in the New England Markets, then the 
ISO must file for Commission approval of such action, and the prohibition or termination 
shall become effective only upon final Commission ruling.  No action by the ISO 
pursuant to this subsection (b) shall limit in any way the ISO’s rights or authority under 
any other provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy or the ISO 
New England Billing Policy.  
 
2. 
Risk Management 
 
(a)  
Each customer and applicant shall submit, on an annual basis (by April 30 each year), a 
certificate in the form of Attachment 3 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy stating that the customer or applicant has: (i) either established or contracted for 
risk management procedures that are applicable to participation in the New England 
Markets; and (ii) has established or contracted for appropriate training of relevant 
personnel that is applicable to its participation in the New England Markets.  The 
certificate must be signed on behalf of the customer or applicant by a Senior Officer of 
the customer or applicant.  An applicant that fails to provide this certificate will be 
prohibited from participating in the New England Markets until the deficiency is 
rectified.  If a customer fails to provide this certificate by end of business on April 30, 
then the ISO shall issue a notice of such failure to the customer on the next Business Day 
and, if the customer does not provide the certificate to the ISO within 5 Business Days 
after issuance of such notice, then the customer will be suspended as described in Section 
III.B.3 of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy until the deficiency is 
rectified. 
 
(b) 
Each applicant prior to commencing activity in the FTR market shall submit to the ISO or 
its designee the written risk management policies, procedures, and controls, including, if 
requested by the ISO in its sole discretion, supporting documentation (which may include 
an organizational chart (or portion thereof) or equivalent information) that demonstrates 
the segregation of duties within such risk policies, procedures, and controls of the such 
customer or applicant, applicable to its participation in the FTR market relied upon by the 
Senior Officer of the applicant signing the certificate provided pursuant to Section II.A.2 
(a).  On an annual basis (by April 30 each year), each Designated FTR Participant with 
FTR transactions in any of the previous twelve months or in any currently open month 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
that exceed 1,000 MW per month (on a net basis, as described in the FTR Financial 
Assurance Requirements provisions in Section VI) shall submit to the ISO or its designee 
a certificate in the form of Attachment 5 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy stating that, since the customer’s delivery of its risk management policies, 
procedures, and controls (and any supporting documentation, if applicable) or its last 
certificate pursuant to this Section II.A.2(b), the customer either: (i) has not made any 
changes to the previously submitted written risk management policies, procedures, and 
controls (and any supporting documentation, if applicable); or (ii) that changes have been 
made to the previously submitted written risk management policies, procedures, and 
controls (and any supporting documentation, if applicable) and that all such changes are 
clearly identified and attached to such certificate.  If any such applicant fails to submit the 
relevant written policies, procedures, and controls, then the applicant will be prohibited 
from participating in the FTR market.  If any such customer fails to provide a certificate 
in the form of Attachment 5 by end of business on April 30, then the ISO shall issue a 
notice of such failure to the customer, and if the customer does not provide the certificate 
to the ISO within two Business Days after issuance of such notice, then the customer will 
be suspended (as described in Section III.B.3.c of the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy) from entering into any future transactions in the FTR system. 
 
 
The ISO, at its sole discretion, may also require any applicant or customer to submit to 
the ISO or its designee the written risk management policies, procedures, and controls, 
including supporting documentation (which may include an organizational chart (or 
portion thereof) or equivalent information) that demonstrates the segregation of duties 
within such risk policies, procedures, and controls of the such customer or applicant, that 
are applicable to its participation in the New England Markets relied upon by the Senior 
Officer of the applicant or customer signing the certificate provided pursuant to Section 
II.A.2(a).  The ISO may require such submissions based on identified risk factors that 
include, but are not limited to, the markets in which the customer is transacting or the 
applicant seeks to transact, the magnitude of the customer’s transactions or the 
applicant’s potential transactions, or the volume of the customer’s open positions.  Where 
the ISO notifies an applicant or customer that such a submission is required, the 
submission shall be due within 5 Business Days of the notice.  If an applicant fails to 
submit the relevant written policies, procedures, and controls as required, then the 
applicant will be prohibited from participating in the New England Markets.  If a 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
customer fails to submit the relevant written policies, procedures, and controls, then the 
ISO shall issue a notice of such failure to the customer, and if the customer fails to submit 
the relevant written policies, procedures, and controls to the ISO or its designee within 
two Business Days after issuance of such notice, then the customer will be suspended (as 
described in Section III.B of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy). 
 
 
The applicant’s or customer’s written policies, procedures, controls, and any supporting 
documentation, received by the ISO or its designee pursuant to this subsection (b) shall 
be treated as Confidential Information. 
 
(c) 
Where an applicant or customer submits risk management policies, procedures, and 
controls, or supporting documentation to the ISO or its designee pursuant to any 
provision of subsection (b) above, the ISO or its designee shall assess that those policies, 
procedures, and controls conform to prudent risk management practices, which include, 
but are not limited to:  (i) addressing market, credit, and operational risk; (ii) segregating 
roles, responsibilities, and functions in the organization; (iii) establishing delegations of 
authority that specify which transactions traders are authorized to enter into; (iv) ensuring 
that traders have sufficient training in systems and the markets in which they transact; (v) 
placing risk limits to control exposure; (vi) requiring reports to ensure that risks are 
adequately communicated throughout the organization; (vii) establishing processes for 
independent confirmation of executed transactions; and (viii) establishing periodic 
valuation or mark-to-market of risk positions as appropriate. 
 
Where, as a result of the assessment described above in this subsection (c), the ISO or its 
designee believes that the applicant’s or customer’s written policies, procedures, and 
controls do not conform to prudent risk management practices, then the ISO or its 
designee shall provide notice to the applicant or customer explaining the deficiencies.  
The applicant or customer shall revise its policies, procedures, and controls to address the 
deficiencies within 55 days after issuance of such notice.  (If April 30 falls within that 55 
day window, the ISO may choose not to require a separate submission on April 30 as 
described in subsection (b) above.)  If an applicant’s revised written policies, procedures, 
and controls do not adequately address the deficiencies identified in the notice, then the 
applicant will be prohibited from participating in the New England Markets.  If a 
customer’s revised written policies, procedures, and controls do not adequately address 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
the deficiencies identified in the notice, then the customer will be suspended (as 
described in Section III.B of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy).  
 
3. 
Communications 
Each customer and applicant shall submit, on an annual basis (by April 30 each year), a 
certificate in the form of Attachment 3 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy stating that the customer or applicant has either established or contracted to 
establish procedures to effectively communicate with and respond to the ISO with respect 
to matters relating to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy and the ISO New 
England Billing Policy.  Such procedures must ensure, at a minimum, that at least one 
person with the ability and authority to address matters related to the ISO New England 
Financial Assurance Policy and the ISO New England Billing Policy on behalf of the 
customer or applicant, including the ability and authority to respond to requests for 
information and to arrange for additional financial assurance as necessary, is available 
from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Business Days.  Such procedures must also 
ensure that the ISO is kept informed about the current contact information (including 
phone numbers and e-mail addresses) for the person or people described above.  The 
certificate must be signed on behalf of the customer or applicant by a Senior Officer of 
the customer or applicant.  An applicant that fails to provide this certificate will be 
prohibited from participating in the New England Markets until the deficiency is 
rectified.  If a customer fails to provide this certificate by end of business on April 30, 
then the ISO shall issue a notice of such failure to the customer on the next Business Day 
and, if the customer does not provide the certificate to the ISO within 5 Business Days 
after issuance of such notice, then the customer will be suspended as described in Section 
III.B.3 of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy until the deficiency is 
rectified.  
 
4. 
Capitalization 
 
(a) 
To be deemed as meeting the capitalization requirements, a customer or applicant shall 
either: 
(i)  
be Rated and have a Governing Rating that is an Investment Grade Rating of 
BBB-/Baa3 or higher; 
(ii)  
maintain a minimum Tangible Net Worth of one million dollars; or 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
(iii) 
maintain a minimum of ten million dollars in total assets, provided that, to meet 
this requirement, a customer or applicant may supplement total assets of less than 
ten million dollars with additional financial assurance in an amount equal to the 
difference between ten million dollars and the customer’s or applicant’s total 
assets in one of the forms described in Section X (any additional financial 
assurance provided pursuant to this Section II.A.4(a) shall not be counted toward 
satisfaction of the total financial assurance requirements as calculated pursuant to 
the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy). 
 
(b) 
Any customer or applicant that fails to meet these capitalization requirements will be 
suspended (as described in Section III.B.3.c of the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy) from entering into any future transactions of a duration greater than 
one month in the FTR system or any future transactions for a duration of one month or 
less except when FTRs for a month are being auctioned for the final time.  Such a 
customer or applicant may enter into future transaction of a duration of one month or less 
in the FTR system in the case of FTRs for a month being auctioned for the final time.  
Any customer or applicant that fails to meet these capitalization requirements shall 
provide additional financial assurance in one of the forms described in Section X of the 
ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy equal to 25 percent of the customer’s or 
applicant’s FTR Financial Assurance Requirements.  Any additional financial assurance 
provided pursuant to this Section II.A.4(b) shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the 
total financial assurance requirements as calculated pursuant to the ISO New England 
Financial Assurance Policy. 
 
(c)  
For markets other than the FTR market: 
 (i)  
Where a customer or applicant fails to meet the capitalization requirements, the 
customer or applicant will be required to provide an additional amount of 
financial assurance in one of the forms described in Section X of the ISO New 
England Financial Assurance Policy in an amount equal to 25 percent of the 
customer’s or applicant’s total financial assurance requirement (excluding FTR 
Financial Assurance Requirements). 
(ii)  
An applicant that fails to provide the full amount of additional financial 
assurance required as described in subsection (i) above will be prohibited from 
participating in the New England Markets until the deficiency is rectified.  For a 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
customer, failure to provide the full amount of additional financial assurance 
required as described in subsection (i) above will have the same effect and will 
trigger the same consequences as exceeding the “100 Percent Test” as described 
in Section III.B.2.c of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy. 
(iii) 
 Any additional financial assurance provided pursuant to this Section II.A.4(c) 
shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the total financial assurance 
requirements as calculated pursuant to the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy. 
 
5. 
Additional Eligibility Requirements 
 
All customers and applicants shall at all times be: 
 
(a) An “appropriate person,” as defined in sections 4(c)(3)(A) through (J) of the 
Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.); 
(b) An “eligible contract participant,” as defined in section 1a(18)(A) of the Commodity 
Exchange Act and in 17 CFR § 1.3(m); or 
(c) A “person who actively participates in the generation, transmission, or distribution of 
electric energy,” as defined in the Final Order of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission published at 78 FR 19880 (April 2, 2013). 
 
Each customer must demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this Section II.A.5 
by submitting to the ISO on or before September 15, 2013 a certificate in the form of 
Attachment 4 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy that (i) certifies that 
the customer is now and in good faith will seek to remain in compliance with the 
requirements of this Section II.A.5 and (ii) further certifies that if it no longer satisfies 
these requirements it shall immediately notify the ISO in writing and shall immediately 
cease all participation in the New England Markets.  If the customer is relying on section 
4(c)(3)(F) of the Commodity Exchange Act, it shall accompany the certification with 
supporting documentation reasonably acceptable to the ISO, provided that letters of credit 
shall be in the form of Attachment 2 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy 
and shall be in an amount equal to the difference between five million dollars and the 
customer’s total assets.  Any such supporting documentation shall serve to establish 
eligibility under this Section II.A.5 and shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
total financial assurance requirements as calculated pursuant to the ISO New England 
Financial Assurance Policy.  The certificate must be signed on behalf of the customer by 
a Senior Officer of the customer.  A customer that fails to provide this certificate by 
September 15, 2013 shall be immediately suspended and the ISO shall initiate 
termination proceedings against the customer. 
 
Each applicant must submit with its membership application a certificate in the form of 
Attachment 4 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy that (i) certifies that 
the applicant is now and in good faith will seek to remain in compliance with the 
requirements of this Section II.A.5 and (ii) further certifies that if it no longer satisfies 
these requirements it shall immediately notify the ISO in writing and shall immediately 
cease all participation in the New England Markets.  If the applicant is relying on section 
4(c)(3)(F) of the Commodity Exchange Act, it shall accompany the certification with 
supporting documentation reasonably acceptable to the ISO, provided that letters of credit 
shall be in the form of Attachment 2 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy 
and shall be in an amount equal to the difference between five million dollars and the 
applicant’s total assets.  Any such supporting documentation shall serve to establish 
eligibility under this Section II.A.5 and shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the 
total financial assurance requirements as calculated pursuant to the ISO New England 
Financial Assurance Policy.  The certificate must be signed on behalf of the applicant by 
a Senior Officer of the applicant. 
 
The ISO, at its sole discretion, may require any applicant or customer to submit to the 
ISO documentation in support of the certification provided pursuant to this Section 
II.A.5. If at any time the ISO becomes aware that a customer no longer satisfies the 
requirements of this Section II.A.5, the customer shall be immediately suspended and the 
ISO shall initiate termination proceedings against the customer. 
 
6. 
Prior Uncured Defaults  
 
In addition to, and not in limitation of Section IV of the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy, an applicant who has a previous uncured payment default must cure 
such payment default by payment to the ISO of all outstanding and unpaid obligations, as 
well as meet all requirements for participation in the New England Markets contained in 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy. For purposes of this Section II.A.6 
and the ISO’s evaluation of information disclosed pursuant to Section II of the ISO New 
England Financial Assurance Policy, the ISO will evaluate relevant factors to determine 
if an entity seeking to participate in the New England Markets under a different name, 
affiliation, or organization, should be treated as the same customer or applicant that 
experienced the previous payment default. Such factors may include, but are not limited 
to, the interconnectedness of the business relationships, overlap in relevant personnel, 
similarity of business activities, overlap of customer base, and the business engaged in 
prior to the attempted re-entry. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an applicant shall not be 
required to cure a payment default that has lawfully been discharged pursuant to the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. 
B.  
Proof of Financial Viability for Applicants  
Each Applicant must, with its membership application and at its own expense, submit 
proof of financial viability, as described below, satisfying the ISO requirements to 
demonstrate the Applicant’s ability to meet its obligations.  Each Applicant that intends 
to establish a Market Credit Limit or a Transmission Credit Limit of greater than $0 
under Section II.D or Section II.E below must submit to the ISO all current rating agency 
reports from Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”), Moody’s and/or Fitch (collectively, the 
“Rating Agencies”).  Each Applicant, whether or not it intends to establish a Market 
Credit Limit or Transmission Credit Limit of greater than $0, must submit to the ISO 
audited financial statements for the two most recent years, or the period of its existence, 
if less than two years, and unaudited financial statements for its last concluded fiscal 
quarter if they are not included in such audited annual financial statements.  These 
unaudited statements must be certified as to their accuracy by a Senior Officer of such 
Applicant, which, for purposes of ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, means 
an officer of the subject entity with the title of vice president (or similar office) or higher, 
or another officer designated in writing to the ISO by that officer.  These audited and 
unaudited statements must include in each case, but are not limited to, the following 
information to the extent available: balance sheets, income statements, statements of cash 
flows and notes to financial statements, annual and quarterly reports, and 10-K, 10-Q and 
8-K Reports.  If any of these financial statements are available on the internet, the 
Applicant may provide instead a letter to the ISO stating where such statement may be 
located and retrieved.  If any of the information or documentation required by this section 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
is not available, alternate requirements may be specified by the ISO, at the ISO’s sole 
discretion (such alternate requirements may include, but are not limited to: (i) 
consolidating statements or other financial statements (in the case of a stand-alone 
subsidiary) that are certified as to their accuracy and basis of accounting (in accordance 
with international accounting standards or generally accepted accounting principles in the 
United States) by an officer of the entity with the title of chief financial officer or 
equivalent position; (ii) reviewed statements; or (iii) compiled statements).   
 
In addition, each Applicant, whether or not it intends to establish a Market Credit Limit 
or a Transmission Credit Limit, must submit to the ISO:  (i) at least one (1) bank 
reference and three (3) utility company credit references, or in those cases where an 
Applicant does not have three (3) utility company credit references, three (3) major trade 
payable vendor references may be substituted; and (ii) relevant information as to any 
known or anticipated material lawsuits, as well as any prior bankruptcy declarations by 
the Applicant, or by its predecessor(s), if any; and (iii) a completed ISO credit 
application. In the case of certain Applicants, some of the information and documentation 
described in items (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence may not be 
applicable or available, and alternate requirements may be specified by the ISO or its 
designee in its sole discretion.    
 
The ISO will not begin its review of a Market Participant’s credit application or the 
accompanying material described above until full and final payment of that  
Market Participant’s application fee.  
 
The ISO shall prepare a report, or cause a report to be prepared, concerning the financial 
viability of each Applicant. In its review of each Applicant, the ISO or its designee shall 
consider all of the information and documentation described in this Section II.  All costs 
incurred by the ISO in its review of the financial viability of an Applicant shall be borne 
by such Applicant and paid at the time that such Applicant is required to pay its first 
annual fee under the Participants Agreement.  For an Applicant applying for transmission 
service from the ISO, all costs incurred by the ISO shall be paid prior to the ISO’s filing 
of a Transmission Service Agreement.  The report shall be provided to the Participants 
Committee or its designee and the affected Applicant within three weeks of the ISO’s 
receipt of that Applicant’s completed application, application fee, and Initial Market 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Participant Financial Assurance Requirement, unless the ISO notifies the Applicant that 
more time is needed to perform additional due diligence with respect to its application.  
 
C.  
Ongoing Review and Credit Ratings 
 
1.  
Rated and Credit Qualifying Market Participants  
A Market Participant that (i) has a corporate rating from one or more of the Rating 
Agencies, or (ii) has senior unsecured debt that is rated by one or more of the Rating 
Agencies, is referred to herein as “Rated.”  A Market Participant that is not Rated is 
referred to herein as “Unrated.” 
 
For all purposes in the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, for a Market 
Participant that is Rated, the lowest corporate rating from any Rating Agency for that 
Market Participant, or, if the Market Participant has no corporate rating, then the lowest 
rating from any Rating Agency for that Market Participant’s senior unsecured debt, shall 
be the “Governing Rating.” 
 
A Market Participant that is:  (i) Rated and whose Governing Rating is an Investment 
Grade Rating; or (ii) Unrated and that satisfies the Credit Threshold is referred to herein 
as “Credit Qualifying.”  A Market Participant that is not Credit Qualifying is referred to 
herein as “Non-Qualifying.” 
 
For purposes of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, “Investment Grade 
Rating” for a Market Participant (other than an FTR-Only Customer) or Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer  is either (a) a corporate investment grade rating from 
one or more of the Rating Agencies, or (b) if the Market Participant or Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer does not have a corporate rating from one of the 
Rating Agencies, then an investment grade rating for the Market Participant’s or Non-
Market Participant Transmission Customer’s senior unsecured debt from one or more of 
the Rating Agencies. 
 
2.  
Unrated Market Participants  
Any Unrated Market Participant that (i) has not been a Market Participant in the ISO for 
at least the immediately preceding 365 days; or (ii) has defaulted on any of its obligations 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
under the Tariff (including without limitation its obligations hereunder and under the ISO 
New England Billing Policy) during such 365-day period; or (iii) is an FTR-Only 
Customer; or (iv) does not have a Current Ratio  of at least 1.0, a Debt-to-Total 
Capitalization Ratio of 0.6 or less, and an EBITDA-to-Interest Expense Ratio of at least 
2.0 must provide an appropriate form of financial assurance as described in Section X 
below.  An Unrated Market Participant that does not meet any of the conditions in clauses 
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph is referred to herein as satisfying the “Credit 
Threshold.”  
 
For purposes of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, “Current Ratio” on 
any date is all of a Market Participant’s or Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Customer’s current assets divided by all of its current liabilities, in each case as shown on 
the most recent financial statements provided by such Market Participant or Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer to the ISO; “Debt-to-Total Capitalization Ratio” on 
any date is a Market Participant’s or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s 
total debt (including all current borrowings) divided by its total shareholders’ equity plus 
total debt, in each case as shown on the most recent financial statements provided by such 
Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer to the ISO; and 
“EBITDA-to-Interest Expense Ratio” on any date is a Market Participant’s or Non-
Market Participant Transmission Customer’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortization in the most recent fiscal quarter divided by that Market Participant’s or 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s expense for interest in that fiscal 
quarter, in each case as shown on the most recent financial statements provided by such 
Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer to the ISO.  The 
“Debt-to-Total Capitalization Ratio” will not be considered for purposes of determining 
whether a Municipal Market Participant satisfies the Credit Threshold. Each of the ratios 
described in this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with international 
accounting standards or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States at 
the time of determination consistently applied.  
 
3. 
Information Reporting Requirements for Market Participants 
Each Market Participant having a Market Credit Limit or Transmission Credit Limit 
greater than zero or meeting the capitalization requirements by maintaining a minimum 
Tangible Net Worth or minimum total assets as described in Section II.A.4(a) shall 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
submit to the ISO, on a quarterly basis within 10 days of its becoming available and 
within 65 days after the end of the applicable fiscal quarter of such Market Participant, its 
balance sheet, which shall show sufficient detail for the ISO to assess the Market 
Participant’s Tangible Net Worth.  Unrated Market Participants having a Market Credit 
Limit or Transmission Credit Limit greater than zero shall also provide additional 
financial statements, which shall show sufficient detail for the ISO to calculate such 
Unrated Market Participant’s Current Ratio, Debt-to-Total Capitalization Ratio and 
EBITDA-to-Interest Expense Ratio.  In addition, each Market Participant having a 
Market Credit Limit or Transmission Credit Limit greater than zero or meeting the 
capitalization requirements by maintaining a minimum Tangible Net Worth or minimum 
total assets as described in Section II.A.4(a) shall submit to the ISO, annually within 10 
days of their becoming available and within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year of 
such Market Participant, balance sheets and income statements (balance sheets and 
income statements that are part of audited financial statements shall be submitted if 
available; if such balance sheets and income statements are not available, then another 
alternative form of financial statements accepted by the ISO as described below may be 
submitted).  If any of this financial information is available on the internet, the Market 
Participant may provide instead a letter to the ISO stating where such information may be 
located and retrieved.  If any of the information or documentation required by this section 
is not available, alternate requirements may be specified by the ISO (such alternate 
requirements may include, but are not limited to: (i) consolidating statements or other 
financial statements (in the case of a stand-alone subsidiary) that are certified as to their 
accuracy and basis of accounting (in accordance with international accounting standards 
or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States) by an officer of the 
entity with the title of chief financial officer or equivalent position; (ii) reviewed 
statements; (iii) compiled statements; (iv) internally prepared statements; or (v) tax 
returns). 
 
Except in the case of a Market Participant or Unrated Market Participant that submits 
audited financial statements to the ISO, financial statements submitted to the ISO 
pursuant to this Section II.C.3 shall be accompanied by a written statement from a Senior 
Officer of the Market Participant or Unrated Market Participant certifying the accuracy of 
those financial statements.  If an attestation was made by an independent accounting firm, 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
then the written statement shall indicate the level of attestation made; if no attestation was 
made by an independent accounting firm, then no such indication is required. 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this subsection, the ISO may require any Market 
Participant to submit the financial statements and other information described in this 
subsection.  The Market Participant shall provide the requested statements and other 
information within 10 days of such request.  If a Market Participant fails to provide 
financial statements or other information as requested and the ISO determines that the 
Market Participant poses an unreasonable risk to the New England Markets, then the ISO 
may request that the Market Participant provide additional financial assurance in an 
amount no greater than $10 million, or take other measures to substantiate the Market 
Participant’s ability to safely transact in the New England Markets (any additional 
financial assurance provided pursuant to this Section II.C.3 shall not be counted toward 
satisfaction of the total financial assurance requirements as calculated pursuant to the ISO 
New England Financial Assurance Policy).  If the Market Participant fails to comply with 
such a request from the ISO, then the ISO may issue a notice of suspension or 
termination to the Market Participant.  If the Market Participant fails to comply with the 
ISO’s request within 5 Business Days from the date of issuance of the notice of 
suspension or termination, then the ISO may suspend or terminate the Market Participant. 
 
A Market Participant may choose not to submit financial statements as described in this 
Section II.C.3, in which case the ISO shall use a value of $0.00 for the Market 
Participant’s total assets and Tangible Net Worth for purposes of the capitalization 
assessment described in Section II.A.4(a) and such Market Participant’s Market Credit 
Limit and Transmission Credit Limit shall be $0.00. 
 
A Market Participant may choose to provide additional financial assurance in an amount 
equal to $10 million in lieu of providing financial statements under this Section II.C.3.  
Such amount shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the total financial assurance 
requirements as calculated pursuant to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy 
but shall be sufficient to meet the capitalization requirements in Section II.A.4(a)(iii). 
 
D.

previous calendar quarter. If no such determination is provided, then the ISO shall apply 
an allocation of $25 million each to the Market Credit Limit and Transmission Credit 
Limit, which values shall also be used in allocating the $50 million credit limit among 
Affiliates.  If the sum of the amounts for Affiliates is greater than $50 million, then the 
ISO shall reduce the amounts (proportionally to the amounts provided by each Affiliate, 
or to the allocation applied by the ISO in the case of an Affiliate that provided no 
determination) such that the sum is no greater than $50 million. 
 
III. 
MARKET PARTICIPANTS’ REQUIREMENTS 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Each Market Participant that provides the ISO with financial assurance pursuant to this Section III must 
provide the ISO with financial assurance in one of the forms described in Section X below and in an 
amount equal to the amount required in order to avoid suspension under Section III.B below (the “Market 
Participant Financial Assurance Requirement”).  A Market Participant’s Market Participant Financial 
Assurance Requirement shall remain in effect as provided herein until the later of (a) 150 days after 
termination of the Market Participant’s membership or (b) the end date of all FTRs awarded to the Market 
Participant and the final satisfaction of all obligations of the Market Participant providing that financial 
assurance; provided, however that financial assurances required by the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy related to potential billing adjustments chargeable to a terminated Market Participant 
shall remain in effect until such billing adjustment request is finally resolved in accordance with the 
provisions of the ISO New England Billing Policy.  Furthermore and without limiting the generality of 
the foregoing, (i) any portion of any financial assurance provided under the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy that relates to a Disputed Amount shall not be terminated or returned prior to the 
resolution of such dispute, even if the Market Participant providing such financial assurance is terminated 
or voluntarily terminates its MPSA and otherwise satisfies all of its obligations to the ISO and (ii) the ISO 
shall not return or permit the termination of any financial assurance provided under the ISO New England 
Financial Assurance Policy by a Market Participant that has terminated its membership or been 
terminated to the extent that the ISO determines in its reasonable discretion that that financial assurance 
will be required under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy with respect to an unsettled 
liability or obligation owing from that Market Participant.  
 
A Market Participant that knows that it is not satisfying its Market Participant Financial Assurance 
Requirement shall notify the ISO immediately of that fact.   
 
A. 
Determination of Financial Assurance Obligations 
For purposes of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy:  
 
(i) 
a Market Participant’s “Hourly Requirements” at any time will be the sum of (x) the 
Hourly Charges (excluding Daily FCM Charges) for such Market Participant that have 
been invoiced but not paid (which amount shall not be less than $0), plus (y) the Hourly 
Charges (excluding Daily FCM Charges) for such Market Participant that have been 
settled but not invoiced, plus (z) the Hourly Charges (excluding Daily FCM Charges) for 
such Market Participant that have been cleared but not settled which amount shall be 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
calculated by the Hourly Charges Estimator.  The Hourly Charges Estimator (which 
amount shall not be less than $0) shall be determined by the following formula:  
 
Hourly Charges Estimator = ∑
HCi × LMP ratio
t
i=t−n+1
× 1.15  
Where: 
t =  
The last day that such Market Participant’s Hourly Charges 
(excluding Daily FCM Charges) are fully settled; 
n =  
The number of days that such Market Participant’s Day-Ahead 
Energy has been cleared but not settled; 
HC =  
The Hourly Charges (excluding Daily FCM Charges) for such 
Market Participant for a fully settled day; and 
LMP ratio =  
The average Day-Ahead Prices at the New England Hub over the 
period of cleared but not settled n days divided by the average 
Day-Ahead Prices at the New England Hub over the period of 
most recent fully settled n days. For purposes of this Section 
III.A.(i), the “New England Hub” shall mean the Hub located in 
Western and Central Massachusetts referred to as 
.H.INTERNAL_HUB;  
 
(ii) 
A Market Participant’s “Daily FCM Requirements” at any time will be the sum of (x) the 
Daily FCM Charges that have been invoiced but not paid (which amount shall not be less 
than $0), plus (y) the Daily FCM Charges that have been settled but not invoiced, plus (z) 
the Daily FCM Charges for such Market Participant that have been incurred but not 
settled which amount shall be calculated by the Daily FCM Obligation Estimator.  The 
Daily FCM Obligation Estimator (which amount shall not be less than $0) shall be 
determined by the following formula: 
 
Daily FCM Obligation Estimator = MAX(FCM_Daily_Credit_CM x NDAY_CM + 
FCM_Daily_Credit_PM x NDAY_PM + FCM_Charge_LD x NDAY_P2 x 
FCA_Price_Ratio, 0) 
Where:  
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
FCM_Daily_Credit_CM is the portion of the Daily FCM Charges that 
corresponds to Capacity Supply Obligations for the Market Participant in the 
current month; 
FCM_Daily_Credit_PM is the portion of the Daily FCM Charges that 
corresponds to Capacity Supply Obligations for the Market Participant in the 
month preceding the current month; 
NDAY_CM is the number of days in the current month within the period from 
the last day the Daily FCM Charges have been settled to the current day (when 
financial assurance is assessed); 
NDAY_PM is the number of days in the month preceding the current month 
within the period from the last day of the Daily FCM Charges have been settled 
to the current day (when financial assurance is assessed); 
FCM_Charge_LD is the portion of the Daily FCM Charges that corresponds to 
Capacity Load Obligations for the Market Participant from the last day the Daily 
FCM Charges have been settled; and 
NDAY_P2 is the number of days from the last day the Daily FCM Charges have 
been settled to the current day (when financial assurance is assessed) plus 2. 
The FCA_Price_Ratio shall be calculated as the weighted average of the 
Capacity Clearing Prices for the Rest-of-Pool Capacity Zone for the relevant 
Capacity Commitment Periods divided by the Capacity Clearing Price for the 
Rest-of-Pool Capacity Zone corresponding to the Capacity Commitment Period 
that contains the last day the Daily FCM Charges have been settled, as 
determined by the following formula: 
FCA_Price_Ratio = (((Clearing Price_CCPn x NDAY_P2_CCPn) + (Clearing 
Price_CCPn+1 x NDAY_P2_CCPn+1))/NDAY_P2)/(Clearing Price_CCPn) 
Where: 
Clearing Price_CCPn is the Capacity Clearing Price for the Rest-of-Pool 
Capacity Zone corresponding to the Capacity Commitment Period that 
contains the last day that the Daily FCM Charges have been settled; 
Clearing Price_CCPn+1 is the Capacity Clearing Price for the Rest-of-
Pool Capacity Zone for the Capacity Commitment Period following 
CCPn; 
NDAY_P2_CCPn is number of days in the CCPn within NDAY_P2; and  
NDAY_P2_CCPn+1 is number of days in the CCPn+1 within NDAY_P2. 
 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
(iii) 
a Market Participant’s “Non-Hourly Requirements” at any time will be determined by 
averaging that Market Participant’s Non-Hourly Charges but not include: (A) the amount 
due from or to such Market Participant for FTR transactions, (B) any amounts due from 
such Market Participant for the Forward Capacity Market, (C) any amounts due under 
Section 14.1 of the RNA, (D) any amounts due for NEPOOL GIS API Fees, and (E) the 
amount of any Qualification Process Cost Reimbursement Deposit (including the annual 
true-up of that amount) due from such Market Participant) over the two most recently 
invoiced calendar months; provided that such Non-Hourly Requirements shall in no event 
be less than zero;   
 
(iv) 
a Market Participant’s  “Transmission Requirements” at any time will be determined by 
averaging that Market Participant’s Transmission Charges over the two most recently 
invoiced calendar months; provided that such Transmission Requirements shall in no 
event be less than $0; 
 
(v) 
a Market Participant’s Virtual Requirements at any time will equal the amount of all 
unsettled Increment Offers and Decrement Bids submitted by such Market Participant at 
such time (which amount of unsettled Increment Offers and Decrement Bids will be 
calculated by the ISO according to a methodology approved from time to time by the 
NEPOOL Budget and Finance Subcommittee and posted on the ISO’s website);   
 
(vi) 
a Market Participant’s “Financial Assurance Obligations” at any time will be equal to the 
sum at such time of:  
 
a. 
such Market Participant’s Hourly Requirements; plus  
b. 
such Market Participant’s Daily FCM Requirements; plus 
c. 
such Market Participant’s Virtual Requirements; plus 
d. 
such Market Participant’s Non-Hourly Requirements times 2.50 (subject to Section X.D 
with respect to Provisional Members); plus 
e. 
such Market Participant’s “FTR Financial Assurance Requirements” under Section VI 
below; plus 
f. 
such Market Participant’s “FCM Financial Assurance Requirements” under Section VII 
below; plus 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
g. 
such Market Participant’s “IEP Financial Assurance Requirement” under Section III.D 
below; plus 
h. 
the amount of any Disputed Amounts received by such Market Participant; and 
 
(vii) 
a Market Participant’s “Transmission Obligations” at any time will be such Market Participant’s 
Transmission Requirements times 2.50. 
 
To the extent that the calculations of the components of a Market Participant’s Financial Assurance 
Obligations (excluding FTR Financial Assurance Requirements) as described above produce positive and 
negative values, such components may offset each other; provided, however, that a Market Participant’s 
Financial Assurance Obligations shall never be less than zero.  
 
B.  
Credit Test Calculations and Allocation of Financial Assurance, Notice and 
Suspension from the New England Markets  
 
1.  
Credit Test Calculations and Allocation of Financial Assurance 
The financial assurance provided by a Market Participant shall be applied as described in 
this Section. 
(a) 
“Market Credit Test Percentage” is equal to a Market Participant’s Financial Assurance 
Obligations (excluding FTR Financial Assurance Requirements) divided by the sum of its 
Market Credit Limit and any financial assurance allocated as described in subsection (d) 
below. 
(b) 
“FTR Credit Test Percentage” is equal to a Market Participant’s FTR Financial 
Assurance Requirements divided by any financial assurance allocated as described in 
subsection (d) below. 
(c) 
“Transmission Credit Test Percentage” is equal to a Market Participant’s Transmission 
Obligations divided by the sum of its Transmission Credit Limit and any financial 
assurance allocated as described in subsection (d) below.   
(d) 
A Market Participant’s financial assurance shall be allocated as follows: 
(i) 
financial assurance shall be first allocated so as to ensure that the Market 
Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage is no greater that 100%; 
(ii) 
any financial assurance that remains after the allocation described in subsection 
(d) (i) shall be allocated so as to ensure that the Market Participant’s FTR Credit 
Test Percentage is no greater than 100%; 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
(iii) 
any financial assurance that remains after the allocation described in subsection 
(d) (ii) shall be allocated so as to ensure that the Market Participant’s 
Transmission Credit Test Percentage is no greater than 100%; 
(iv) 
if any financial assurance remains after the allocations described in subsection 
(d) (iii), then that remaining financial assurance shall be allocated by repeating 
the steps described in subsections (d) (i), (d) (ii), and (d) (iii) to ensure that the 
respective test percentages are no greater than 89.99%; 
(v) 
if any financial assurance remains after the allocation described in subsection (d) 
(iv), then that remaining financial assurance shall be allocated by repeating the 
steps described in subsections (d) (i), (d) (ii), and (d) (iii) to ensure that the 
respective test percentages are no greater than 79.99%; 
(vi) 
any financial assurance that remains after the allocations described in subsection 
(d) (v) shall be allocated to the Market Credit Test Percentage. 
 
2. 
Notices 
 
a.   
80 Percent Test  
When a Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, 
or Transmission Credit Test Percentage equals or exceeds 80 percent (80%), the ISO 
shall issue notice thereof to such Market Participant.   
b.   
90 Percent Test  
When a Market Participant’s  Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage 
or Transmission Credit Test Percentage equals or exceeds 90 percent (90%) , then, in 
addition to the actions to be taken when the Market Participant’s Market Credit Test 
Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, or Transmission Credit Test Percentage equals 
or exceeds 80 percent (80%), the ISO shall issue notice thereof to such Market 
Participant. The ISO shall also issue a 90 percent (90%) notice to a Market Participant 
and take certain other actions under the circumstances described in Section III.B.2.c 
below. 
c.   
100 Percent Test  
When a Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, 
or Transmission Credit Test Percentage exceeds 100 percent (100%) or when the sum of 
the financial assurance and credit limits of a Market Participant that has financial 
assurance requirements equal zero, then, in addition to the actions to be taken when the 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, or 
Transmission Credit Test Percentage equals or exceeds 80 percent (80%) and 90 percent 
(90%), (i) the ISO shall issue notice thereof to such Market Participant, (ii) that Market 
Participant shall be immediately suspended from submitting Increment Offers and 
Decrement Bids until such time when its Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test 
Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test Percentage are less than or equal to 100 percent 
(100%), and (iii) if sufficient financial assurance to lower the Market Participant’s 
Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit 
Test Percentage to less than or equal to 100 percent (100%) or, in the case of a Market 
Participant that has received one to five notices that its Market Credit Test Percentage, 
FTR Credit Test Percentage, or Transmission Credit Test Percentage exceeds 100 percent 
(100%) in the previous 365 days (not including the instant notice), sufficient financial 
assurance to lower such Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit 
Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test Percentage to less than or equal to 90 
percent (90%), is not provided by 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the next Business Day, (a) 
the event shall be a Financial Assurance Default; (b) the ISO shall issue notice thereof to 
such Market Participant, to the NEPOOL Budget and Finance Subcommittee, to all 
members and alternates of the Participants Committee, to the New England governors 
and utility regulatory agencies and to the billing and credit contacts for all Market 
Participants, and (c) such Market Participant shall be suspended from: (1) the New 
England Markets, as provided below; (2) receiving transmission service under any 
existing or pending arrangements under the Tariff or scheduling any future transmission 
service under the Tariff; (3) voting on matters before the Participants Committee and 
NEPOOL Technical Committees; (4) entering into any future transactions in the FTR 
system; and (5) submitting an offer of Non-Commercial Capacity in any Forward 
Capacity Auction or any reconfiguration auction in the Forward Capacity Market, in each 
case until such Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test 
Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test Percentage are at 100 percent  (100%) or less.   
In addition to all of the provisions above, any Market Participant that has received six or 
more notices in the previous 365 days that its Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit 
Test Percentage, or Transmission Credit Test Percentage has exceeded 100 percent 
(100%) shall receive a notice thereof and shall be required to maintain sufficient financial 
assurance to keep such Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit 
Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test Percentage at less than or equal to 90 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
percent (90%). If such Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit 
Test Percentage or Transmission Credit Test Percentage exceeds 90 percent (90%), the 
ISO shall issue a notice thereof to such Market Participant. If sufficient financial 
assurance to lower such Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit 
Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test Percentage to less than or equal to 90 
percent (90%) is not provided by 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the next Business Day, then 
the consequences described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section III.B.2.c (iii) above 
shall apply until such Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit 
Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test Percentage are at 90 percent (90%) or 
less. 
 
However, when a Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test 
Percentage, or Transmission Credit Test Percentage exceeds 100 percent (100%) or 90 
percent (90%), as applicable under this Section III.B.2.c, solely because its Investment 
Grade Rating is downgraded by one grade and the resulting grade is BBB-/Baa3 or 
higher, then (x) for five Business Days after such downgrade, such downgrade shall not 
by itself cause a change to such Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR 
Credit Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test Percentage and (y) no notice shall 
be sent and none of the other actions described in this Section III.B shall occur with 
respect to such downgrade if such Market Participant cures such default within such five 
Business Day period.  When a Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR 
Credit Test Percentage, or Transmission Credit Test Percentage exceeds 100 percent 
solely because a letter of credit is valued at $0 prior to the termination of that letter of 
credit, as described in Section X.B, then the ISO, in its sole discretion, may determine 
that: (x) for five Business Days after such change in the valuation of the letter of credit, 
such valuation shall not by itself cause a change to such Market Participant’s Market 
Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test 
Percentage; and/or (y) no notice shall be sent and none of the other actions described in 
this Section III.B shall occur with respect to such valuation if such Market Participant 
cures such default within such five Business Day period. 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Market Participant shall neither (x) receive a notice that 
its Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, or Transmission Credit 
Test Percentage exceeds 100 percent (100%) nor (y) be suspended under this Section 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
III.B if (i) the amount of financial assurance necessary for  that Market Participant’s 
Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit 
Test Percentage to get to 100 percent (100%) or lower is less than $1,000 or (ii) that 
Market Participant’s status with the ISO has been terminated.  
 
3.  
Suspension from the New England Markets  
 
a.  
General  
The suspension of a Market Participant, and any resulting annulment, termination or 
removal of OASIS reservations, removal from the settlement system and the FTR system, 
suspension of the ability to offer Non-Commercial Capacity or participate in a 
substitution auction in the Forward Capacity Market, drawing down of financial 
assurance, rejection of Increment Offers and Decrement Bids, and rejection of bilateral 
transactions submitted to the ISO, shall not limit, in any way, the ISO’s right to invoice 
or collect payment for any amounts owed (whether such amounts are due or becoming 
due) by such suspended Market Participant under the Tariff or the ISO’s right to 
administratively submit a bid or offer of a Market Participant’s Non-Commercial 
Capacity in any Forward Capacity Auction or any reconfiguration auction or to make 
other adjustments under Market Rule 1.  
 
In addition to the notices provided herein, the ISO will provide any additional 
information required under the ISO New England Information Policy.  
 
Each notice issued by the ISO pursuant to this Section III.B shall indicate whether the 
subject Market Participant has a registered load asset. If the ISO has issued a notice 
pursuant to this Section III.B and subsequently the subject Market Participant’s Market 
Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, and Transmission Credit Test 
Percentage are equal to or less than 100 percent (100%), such Market Participant may 
request the ISO to issue a notice stating such fact.  However, the ISO shall not be 
obligated to issue such a notice unless, in its sole discretion, the ISO concludes that such 
Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, and 
Transmission Credit Test Percentage are equal to or less than 100 percent (100%).  
   
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, 
FTR Credit Test Percentage, or Transmission Credit Test Percentage equals or exceeds 
90 percent (90%) as a result of one or more Increment Offers or Decrement Bids 
submitted by that Market Participant, or as a result of the submission to the ISO of one or 
more bilateral transactions to which the Market Participant is a party, and, but for such 
Increment Offers and/or Decrement Bids or such bilateral transactions, such Market 
Participant would be in compliance with the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy, a notice will not be issued.   
 
If a Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, or 
Transmission Credit Test Percentage exceeds 100 percent (100%) as a result of one or 
more Increment Offers or Decrement Bids submitted by that Market Participant, or as a 
result of the submission to the ISO of one or more bilateral transactions to which the 
Market Participant is a party, and, but for such Increment Offers and/or Decrement Bids 
or such bilateral transactions, such Market Participant would be in compliance with the 
ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, a notice will be issued only to such 
Market Participant, and such Market Participant shall be “suspended” as described below.   
 
Any such suspension as a result of one or more Increment Offers or Decrement Bids 
submitted by a Market Participant, or as a result of the submission to the ISO of one or 
more bilateral transactions to which the Market Participant is a party, shall take effect 
immediately upon submission of such Increment Offers and/or Decrement Bids or such 
bilateral transactions to remain in effect until such Market Participant is in compliance 
with the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, notwithstanding any provision of 
this Section III.B to the contrary.  
 
If a Market Participant is suspended from the New England Markets in accordance with 
the provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy or the ISO New 
England Billing Policy, then the provisions of this Section III.B shall control 
notwithstanding any other provision of the Tariff to the contrary.  A suspended Market 
Participant shall have no ability so long as it is suspended (i) to be reflected in the ISO’s 
settlement system, including any bilateral transactions, as either a purchaser or a seller of 
any products or services sold through the New England Markets (other than (A) 
Commercial Capacity and (B) Non-Commercial Capacity during the Non-Commercial 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Capacity Cure Period) that cause such suspended Market Participant to incur a financial 
obligation in the ISO’s settlement system or any liability to the ISO, NEPOOL, or the 
Market Participants, (ii) to submit Demand Bids, Decrement Bids or Increment Offers in 
the New England Markets, (iii) to submit offers for Non-Commercial Capacity in any 
Forward Capacity Auction or reconfiguration auction or acquire Non-Commercial 
Capacity through a Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral, or (iv) to submit supply offers 
or demand bids in any Forward Capacity Market substitution auction.  Any transactions, 
including bilateral transactions with a suspended Market Participant (other than 
transactions for (A) Commercial Capacity and (B) Non-Commercial Capacity during the 
Non-Commercial Capacity Cure Period) that cause such suspended Market Participant to 
incur a financial obligation in the ISO’s settlement system or any liability to the ISO, 
NEPOOL, or the other Market Participants and any Demand Bids, Decrement Bids, 
Increment Offers, and Export Transactions submitted by a suspended Market Participant 
shall be deemed to be terminated for purposes of the Day-Ahead Energy Market clearing 
and the ISO’s settlement system.  If a Market Participant has provided the financial 
assurance required for a Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral or Annual Reconfiguration 
Transaction, then that Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral or Annual Reconfiguration 
Transaction, respectively, will not be deemed to be terminated when that Market 
Participant is suspended.  
b.  
Load Assets  
Any load asset registered to a suspended Market Participant shall be terminated, and the 
obligation to serve the load associated with such load asset shall be assigned to the 
relevant unmetered load asset(s) unless and until the host Market Participant for such 
load assigns the obligation to serve such load to another asset.  If the suspended Market 
Participant is responsible for serving an unmetered load asset, such suspended Market 
Participant shall retain the obligation to serve such unmetered load asset.  If a suspended 
Market Participant has an ownership share of a load asset, such ownership share shall 
revert to the Market Participant that assigned such ownership share to such suspended 
Market Participant.  If a suspended Market Participant has the obligation under the Tariff 
or otherwise to offer any of its supply or to bid any pumping load to provide products or 
services sold through the New England Markets, that obligation shall continue, but only 
in Real-Time, notwithstanding the Market Participant’s suspension, and such offer or bid, 
if cleared under the Tariff, shall be effective.   
c.  
FTRs  
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
If a Market Participant is suspended from entering into future transactions in the FTR 
system, such Market Participant shall retain all FTRs held by it but shall be prohibited 
from acquiring any additional FTRs during the course of its suspension.  It is intended 
that any suspension under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy or the ISO 
New England Billing Policy will occur promptly, and the definitive timing of any such 
suspension shall be determined by the ISO from time to time as reported to the NEPOOL 
Budget and Finance Subcommittee, and shall be posted on the ISO website.  
           d.  
Virtual Transactions  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Market Participant is suspended in accordance with 
the provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy as a result of one or 
more Increment Offers or Decrement Bids submitted by that Market Participant and, but 
for such Increment Offers and/or Decrement Bids, such Market Participant would be in 
compliance with the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, then such suspension 
shall be limited to (i) the immediate “last in, first out” rejection of pending individual 
uncleared Increment Offers and Decrement Bids submitted by that Market Participant (it 
being understood that Increment Offers and Decrement Bids are batched by the ISO in 
accordance with the time, and that Increment Offers and Decrement Bids will be rejected 
by the batch); and (ii) the suspension of that Market Participant’s ability to submit 
additional Increment Offers and Decrement Bids unless and until it has complied with the 
ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, and the determination of compliance for 
these purposes will take into account the level of aggregate outstanding obligations of 
that Market Participant after giving effect to the immediate rejection of that Market 
Participant’s Increment Offers and Decrement Bids described in clause (i).  
e. 
Bilateral Transactions 
If the sum of the financial assurance and credit limits of a Market Participant that has 
financial assurance requirements equals zero and that Market Participant would be in 
compliance with the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy but for the 
submission of bilateral transactions to the ISO to which the Market Participant is a party, 
or if a Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, 
or Transmission Credit Test Percentage exceeds 100 percent as a result of one or more 
bilateral transactions submitted to the ISO to which the Market Participant is a party, then 
the consequences described in subsection (a) above shall be limited to:  (i) rejection of 
any pending bilateral transactions to which a Market Participant is a party that cause the 
Market Participant to incur a financial obligation in the ISO’s settlement system or any 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
liability to the ISO, NEPOOL, or the Market Participants, such that the aggregate value 
of the pending bilateral transactions submitted by all Market Participants is maximized 
(recognizing the downstream effect that rejection of a bilateral transaction may have on 
the Market Credit Test Percentages, FTR Credit Test Percentages, or Transmission Credit 
Test Percentages of other Market Participants), while ensuring that the financial 
assurance requirements of each Market Participant are satisfied; and (ii) suspension of 
that Market Participant’s ability to submit additional bilateral transactions until it has 
complied with the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy (the determination of 
compliance for these purposes will take into account the level of aggregate outstanding 
obligations of the Market Participant after giving effect to the immediate rejection of the 
bilateral transactions to which the Market Participant is a party as described in clause (i) 
above).  In the case of a bilateral transaction associated with the Day-Ahead Energy 
Market, the ISO will provide notice to a Market Participant that would be in default of 
the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy as a result of the bilateral transaction, 
and the consequences described in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall only apply if the 
Market Participant fails to cure its default by 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time of that same 
Business Day. In the case of a Capacity Load Obligation Bilateral, the consequences 
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall apply if the Market Participant does not cure 
its default within one Business Day after notification that a Capacity Load Obligation 
Bilateral caused the default.  Bilateral transactions that transfer Forward Reserve 
Obligations and Supplemental Availability Bilaterals are not subject to the provisions of 
this Section III.B.3(e). 
 
4. 
Serial Notice and Suspension Penalties  
If either (x) a Market Participant is suspended from the New England Markets because of 
a failure to satisfy its Financial Assurance Requirements in accordance with the 
provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy or (y) a Market 
Participant receives more than five notices that its Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR 
Credit Test Percentage or Transmission Credit Test Percentage has exceeded 100 percent 
(100%) in any rolling 365-day period, then such Market Participant shall pay a $1,000 
penalty for such suspension and for each notice after the fifth notice in a rolling 365-day 
period.  If a Market Participant receives a notice that its Market Credit Test Percentage, 
FTR Credit Test Percentage, or Transmission Credit Test Percentage has exceeded 100 
percent (100%) in the same day, then only one of those notices will count towards the 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
five notice limit. All penalties paid under this paragraph shall be deposited in the Late 
Payment Account maintained under the ISO New England Billing Policy.  
  
C.  
Additional Financial Assurance Requirements for Certain Municipal Market 
Participants  
Notwithstanding the other provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy and in addition to the other obligations hereunder, a Credit Qualifying Municipal 
Market Participant that is not a municipality (which, for purposes of this Section III.C, 
does not include an agency or subdivision of a municipality) must provide additional 
financial assurance in one of the forms described in Section X below in an amount equal 
to its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements at the time of calculation, unless either: (1) 
that Credit Qualifying Municipal Market Participant has a corporate Investment Grade 
Rating from one or more of the Rating Agencies; or (2) that Credit Qualifying Municipal 
Market Participant has an Investment Grade Rating from one or more of the Rating 
Agencies for all of its rated indebtedness; or (3) that Credit Qualifying Municipal Market 
Participant provides the ISO with an opinion of counsel that is acceptable to the ISO 
confirming that amounts due to the ISO under the Tariff have priority over, or have equal 
priority with, payments due on the debt on which the Credit Qualifying Municipal Market 
Participant’s Investment Grade Rating is based.  Each legal opinion provided under 
clause (3) of this Section III.C will be updated no sooner than 60 days and no later than 
30 days before each reconfiguration auction that precedes a Capacity Commitment Period 
to which such legal opinion relates, and if that update is not provided or that update is not 
acceptable to the ISO, the applicable Credit Qualifying Municipal Market Participant 
must either satisfy one of the other clauses of this Section III.C or provide additional 
financial assurance in one of the forms described in Section X below in an amount equal 
to its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements at the time of calculation.  
 
D.  
Inventoried Energy Program Financial Assurance Requirement 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy and in addition to the other obligations hereunder, if any Market Participant has 
submitted a Forward Energy Inventory Election approved by the ISO under Section 
III.K.1.1 of the Tariff, such Market Participant shall be subject to the additional financial 
assurance requirements of this section.  Any such Market Participant must provide 
additional financial assurance in one of the forms described in Section X below in an 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
amount equal to the Inventoried Energy Program Financial Assurance Requirement on or 
before December 1 of each program year.  The Inventoried Energy Program Financial 
Assurance Requirement will be calculated on a daily basis for each program year, from 
December 1, 2023 through February 29, 2024 and separately from December 1, 2024 
through February 28, 2025, as follows: 
 
IEP Financial Assurance Requirement = MAX(0, FE_MWh - Q_MWh) * D_95 * MF * 
SPR 
Where:  
FE_MWh = is the amount of Forward Energy Inventory elected by the 
Market Participant; 
Q_MWh = is the maximum observed physical inventory over the prior 
15 days; 
D_95 = is the 95th percentile of observed Inventoried Energy Days, 
which for the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 program years shall be 19; 
MF = is the month factor, which shall be 100% for December, 87% for 
January, and 26% for February; and 
SPR = spot payment rate = the $/MWh rate used in the calculation of 
Inventoried Energy Spot Payments as described in Section III.K.3.2 of 
the Tariff. 
 
IV.  
CERTAIN NEW AND RETURNING MARKET PARTICIPANTS REQUIREMENTS  
A new Market Participant or a Market Participant other than an FTR-Only Customer, or a Governance 
Only Member whose previous membership as a Market Participant was involuntarily terminated due to a 
Financial Assurance Default or a payment default and, since returning, has been a Market Participant for 
less than six consecutive months (a “Returning Market Participant”) is required to provide the ISO, for 
three months in the case of a new Market Participant and six months in the case of a Returning Market 
Participant, financial assurance in one of the forms described in Section X below equal to any amount of 
additional financial assurance required to meet the capitalization requirements described in Section II.A.4 
plus the greater of (a) its Financial Assurance Requirement or  (b) its “Initial Market Participant Financial 
Assurance Requirement.”  A new Market Participant’s or a Returning Market Participant’s Initial Market 
Participant Financial Assurance Requirement must be provided to the ISO no later than one Business Day 
before commencing activity in the New England Markets or commencing transmission service under the 
Tariff, and shall be determined by the following formula: 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
  
FAR = G + T + L +E  
 
Where FAR is the Initial Market Participant Financial Assurance Requirement and G, T, L and E are 
determined by the following formulas:  
 
G = (MWg x HrDA x D x 3.25) + (MWg x HrMIS x S2 x 3.25);  
 
Where:  
MWg =  
Total nameplate capacity of the Market Participant’s generation units that have 
achieved commercial operation;  
 
HrDA =  
The number of hours of generation that any such generation unit could be bid in 
the Day-Ahead Energy Market before it could be removed if such unit tripped, as 
determined by the ISO in its sole discretion;  
 
D =  
The maximum observed differential between Energy prices in the Day-Ahead 
and Real-Time Energy Markets during the prior calendar year (“Maximum 
Energy Price Differential”), as determined by the ISO in its sole discretion;  
 
HrMIS =  
The standard number of hours between generation and the issuance of initial 
Market Information Server (“MIS”) settlement reports including projected 
generation activity for such units, as determined by the ISO in its sole discretion; 
and  
 
S2 =  
The per MW amount assessed pursuant to Schedule 2 of Section IV.A of this 
Tariff, as determined by the ISO.  
 
T =  
MWt x HrMIS x (D + S2-3) x 3.25;  
 
Where:  
MWt = Number of MWs to be traded in the New England Markets as 
reasonably projected by the new Market Participant or the Returning 
Market Participant;  
 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
HrMIS = The standard number of hours between generation and the

writing.  Each Rated Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer may provide such 
determination for up to four consecutive calendar quarters.  If a Rated Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer does not provide such determination, then the ISO 
shall use the amounts provided for the previous calendar quarter. If no such determination 
is provided, then the ISO shall apply an allocation of $25 million each to the Market 
Credit Limit and Transmission Credit Limit, which values shall also be used in allocating 
the $50 million credit limit among Affiliates.  If the sum of the amounts for Affiliates is 
greater than $50 million, then the ISO shall reduce the amounts (proportionally to the 
amounts provided by each Affiliate, or to the allocation applied by the ISO in the case of 
an Affiliate that provided no determination) such that the sum is no greater than $50 
million. 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000

requirements by maintaining a minimum Tangible Net Worth or minimum total assets as 
described in Section II.A.4(a) shall submit to the ISO, annually within 10 days of their 
becoming available and within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year of such Rated 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer, balance sheets and income statements 
(balance sheets and income statements that are part of audited financial statements shall 
be submitted if available; if such balance sheets and income statements are not available, 
then another alternative form of financial statements accepted by the ISO as described 
below may be submitted).  If any of this financial information is available on the internet, 
the Rated Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer may provide instead a letter to 
the ISO stating where such information may be located and retrieved.  
 
Each Unrated Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer having a Market Credit 
Limit or Transmission Credit Limit greater than zero or meeting the capitalization 
requirements by maintaining a minimum Tangible Net Worth or minimum total assets as 
described in Section II.A.4(a) shall submit to the ISO, on a quarterly basis, within 10 
days of their becoming available and within 65 days after the end of the applicable fiscal 
quarter of such Unrated Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer, its balance 
sheet, which shall show sufficient detail for the ISO to assess the Unrated Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer’s Tangible Net Worth. Unrated Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customers having a Market Credit Limit or Transmission Credit 
Limit greater than $0 shall also provide additional financial statements, which shall show 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
sufficient detail for the ISO to calculate such Unrated Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer’s Current Ratio, Debt-to-Total Capitalization Ratio and 
EBITDA-to-Interest Expense Ratio.  In addition, each such Unrated Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer that satisfies the Credit Threshold and has a Market 
Credit Limit or Transmission Credit Limit of greater than $0 or meeting the capitalization 
requirements by maintaining a minimum Tangible Net Worth or minimum total assets as 
described in Section II.A.4(a) shall submit to the ISO, annually within 10 days of 
becoming available and within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year of such Unrated 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer balance sheets and income statements 
(balance sheets and income statements that are part of audited financial statements shall 
be submitted if available; if such balance sheets and income statements are not available, 
then another alternative form of financial statements accepted by the ISO as described 
below may be submitted).  Where any of the above financial information is available on 
the internet, the Unrated Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer may provide 
the ISO with a letter stating where such information may be located and retrieved.   
 
If any of the information or documentation required by this section is not available, 
alternate requirements may be specified by the ISO (such alternate requirements may 
include, but are not limited to: (i) consolidating statements or other financial statements 
(in the case of a stand-along subsidiary) that are certified as to their accuracy and basis of 
accounting (in accordance with international accounting standards or generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States) by an officer of the entity with the title of 
chief financial officer or equivalent position; (ii) reviewed statements; (iii) compiled 
statements; (iv) internally prepared statements; or (v) tax returns). 
 
Except in the case of a Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer that submits 
audited financial statements to the ISO, financial statements submitted to the ISO 
pursuant to this Section V.C shall be accompanied by a written statement from a Senior 
Officer of the Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer certifying the accuracy of 
those financial statements.  If an attestation was made by an independent accounting firm, 
then the written statement shall indicate the level of attestation made; if no attestation was 
made by an independent accounting firm, then no such indication is required. 
 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this subsection, the ISO may require any Non-
Market Participant Transmission Customer to submit the financial statements and other 
information described in this subsection.  The Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Customer shall provide the requested statements and other information within 10 days of 
such request.  If a Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer fails to provide 
financial statements or other information as requested and the ISO determines that the 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer poses an unreasonable risk to the New 
England Markets, then the ISO may request that the Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer provide additional financial assurance in an amount no greater 
than $10 million, or take other measures to substantiate the Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer’s ability to safely transact in the New England Markets (any 
additional financial assurance provided pursuant to this Section V.C shall not be counted 
toward satisfaction of the total financial assurance requirements as calculated pursuant to 
the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy).  If the Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer fails to comply with such a request from the ISO, then the ISO 
may issue a notice of suspension or termination to the Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer.  If the Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer fails to 
comply with the ISO’s request within 5 Business Days from the date of issuance of the 
notice of suspension or termination, then the ISO may suspend or terminate the Non-
Market Participant Transmission Customer.  
 
A Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer may choose not to submit financial 
statements as described in this Section V.C, in which case the ISO shall use a value of 
$0.00 for the Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s total assets and Tangible 
Net Worth for purposes of the capitalization assessment described in Section II.A.4(a) 
and such Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s Market Credit Limit and 
Transmission Credit Limit shall be $0.00. 
 
A Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer may choose to provide additional 
financial assurance in an amount equal to $10 million in lieu of providing financial 
statements under this Section V.C.  Such amount shall not be counted toward satisfaction 
of the total financial assurance requirements as calculated pursuant to the ISO New 
England Financial Assurance Policy but shall be sufficient to meet the capitalization 
requirements in Section II.A.4(a)(iii). 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
 
D.  
Financial Assurance Requirement for Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Customers  
Each Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer that provides additional financial 
assurance pursuant to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy must provide the 
ISO with financial assurance in one of the forms described in Section X below and in the 
amount described in this Section V.D (the “NMPTC Financial Assurance Requirement”).  
 
1. 
Financial Assurance for ISO Charges 
Each Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer must provide the ISO with 
additional financial assurance such that the sum of its Market Credit Limit and that 
additional financial assurance shall at all times be at least equal to the sum of:  
 
(i) 
two and one-half (2.5) times the average monthly Non-Hourly Charges for such Non-
Market Participant Transmission Customer  over the two most recently invoiced calendar 
months (which amount shall not in any event be less than $0); plus  
(ii) 
amount of any unresolved Disputed Amounts received by such Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer.  
 
2. 
Financial Assurance for Transmission Charges 
Each Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer must provide the ISO with 
additional financial assurance hereunder such that the sum of (x) its Transmission Credit 
Limit and (y) the excess of (A) the available amount of the additional financial assurance 
provided by that Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer over (B) the amount of 
that additional financial assurance needed to satisfy the requirements of Section V.D.1 
above is equal to two and one-half (2.5) times the average monthly Transmission Charges 
for such Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer over the two most recently 
invoiced calendar months (which amount shall not in any event be less than $0) 
 
3. 
Notice of Failure to Satisfy NMPTC Financial Assurance Requirement 
A Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer that knows or can reasonably be 
expected to know that it is not satisfying its NMPTC Financial Assurance Requirement 
shall notify the ISO immediately of that fact.  Without limiting the availability of any 
other remedy or right hereunder, failure by any Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Customer to comply with the provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy (including failure to satisfy its NMPTC Financial Assurance Requirement) may 
result in the commencement of termination of service proceedings against that non-
complying Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer.  
 
VI.  
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR FTR TRANSACTIONS  
Market Participants must complete an ISO-prescribed training course prior to participating in the FTR 
Auction. All Market Participants transacting in the FTR Auction that are otherwise required to provide 
additional financial assurance under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, including all 
FTR-Only Customers (“Designated FTR Participants”) are required to provide financial assurance in an 
amount equal to the sum of the FTR Settlement Risk Financial Assurance, the Unsettled FTR Financial 
Assurance, and the Settlement Financial Assurance, each as described in this Section VI (such sum being 
referred to in the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy as the “FTR Financial Assurance 
Requirements”).  
 
A.  
FTR Settlement Risk Financial Assurance  
A Designated FTR Participant is required to provide “FTR Settlement Risk Financial 
Assurance” for each bid it submits into an FTR Auction and for each FTR that is awarded 
to it in an FTR Auction, as described below.  
 
After bids are finalized for an FTR Auction, but before the auction results are final, a 
Designated FTR Participant must provide FTR Settlement Risk Financial Assurance 
based on its bids for each FTR path.  The ISO will calculate an FTR Settlement Risk 
Financial Assurance amount for each direction (prevailing flow and counter flow) of each 
FTR path on which the Designated FTR Participant has bid, equal to the total number of 
MW bid for that direction of the FTR path multiplied by the applicable proxy value for 
the FTR path (as described below) multiplied by the number of hours associated with the 
bid.  For that FTR path, the Designated FTR Participant must provide FTR Settlement 
Risk Financial Assurance equal to the higher of the amounts calculated for each direction. 
 
Once an FTR Auction’s results are final, a Designated FTR Participant must provide FTR 
Settlement Risk Financial Assurance based on awarded FTRs, equal to the MW value of  
each awarded FTR multiplied by the applicable proxy value for the FTR path (as 
described below) multiplied by the number of hours associated with the FTR.  For 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
purposes of this calculation, the ISO will net the MW values of a Designated FTR 
Participant’s awarded FTRs having the same or opposite path, same contract month, and 
same type (on-peak or off-peak).  For purposes of this netting, annual FTRs may be 
converted into monthly positions. 
 
The proxy value for each FTR path, which shall be calculated separately for on-peak and 
off-peak FTRs, will be based on the standard deviation observed in the difference 
between the average congestion components of the Locational Marginal Price in the Day-
Ahead Energy Market at the path’s sink and source for the previous 36 months, with 
differing multipliers for annual and monthly FTRs and for prevailing flow and counter 
flow paths.  These multipliers will be reviewed and approved by the NEPOOL Budget 
and Finance Subcommittee and shall be posted on the ISO’s website.  Where there is 
insufficient data to perform these calculations for a node, zonal data will be used instead. 
 
FTR Settlement Risk Financial Assurance will be adjusted as the awarded FTRs are 
settled. In no event will the FTR Settlement Risk Financial Assurance be less than $0.  
 
B.  
Unsettled FTR Financial Assurance  
A Designated FTR Participant is required to maintain, at all times, “Unsettled FTR 
Financial Assurance” for all FTRs awarded to it in any FTR Auctions.   Immediately after 
FTRs are awarded in an FTR Auction, the Unsettled FTR Financial Assurance for those 
FTRs shall be zero.  After subsequent FTR Auctions, the Unsettled FTR Financial 
Assurance for each FTR awarded in a previous FTR Auction shall be adjusted to reflect 
any change in the clearing price for that FTR based on non-zero volume.  The adjustment 
will be equal to the change in the clearing price multiplied by the number of MW of the 
previously awarded FTR, with increases in the clearing price reducing the Unsettled FTR 
Financial Assurance amount and decreases in the clearing price increasing the Unsettled 
FTR Financial Assurance amount.  For purposes of these calculations, the ISO will 
consider FTRs having the same or opposite path, same contract month, and same type 
(on-peak or off-peak) together.  A Designated FTR Participant’s Unsettled FTR Financial 
Assurance may be a charge or a credit, and in the case of a credit, may offset the 
Designated FTR Participant’s other FTR Financial Assurance Requirements (but not to 
less than zero).  A Designated FTR Participant’s Unsettled FTR Financial Assurance will 
be adjusted as the awarded FTRs are settled.   
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
 
C.  
Settlement Financial Assurance  
A Designated FTR Participant that has been awarded a bid in an FTR Auction is required 
to provide “Settlement Financial Assurance.” The amount of a Designated FTR 
Participant’s Settlement Financial Assurance shall be equal to the amount of any settled 
but uninvoiced Charges incurred by such Designated FTR Participant for FTR 
transactions less the settled but uninvoiced amounts due to such Market Participant for 
FTR transactions. These amounts shall include the costs of acquiring FTRs as well as 
payments and charges associated with FTR settlement. 
 
D.  
Consequences of Failure to Satisfy FTR Financial Assurance Requirements  
If a Designated FTR Participant does not have additional financial assurance equal to its 
FTR Financial Assurance Requirements (in addition to its other financial assurance 
obligations hereunder) in place at the time an FTR Auction into which it has bid closes, 
then, in addition to the other consequences described in the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy, all bids submitted by that Designated FTR Participant for that FTR 
Auction will be rejected.  The Designated FTR Participant will be allowed to participate 
in the next FTR Auction held provided it meets all requirements for such participation, 
including without limitation those set forth herein.  Each Designated FTR Participant 
must maintain the requisite additional financial assurance equal to its FTR Financial 
Assurance Requirements for the duration of the FTRs awarded to it.  The amount of any 
additional financial assurance provided by a Designated FTR Participant in connection 
with an unsuccessful bid in an FTR Auction which, as a result of such bid being 
unsuccessful, is in excess of its FTR Financial Assurance Requirements will be held by 
the ISO and will be applied against future FTR bids by and awards to that Designated 
FTR Participant unless that Designated FTR Participant requests in writing to have such 
excess financial assurance returned to it.  Prior to returning any financial assurance to a 
Designated FTR Participant, the ISO shall use such financial assurance to satisfy any 
overdue obligations of that Designated FTR Participant. The ISO shall only return to that 
Designated FTR Participant the balance of such financial assurance after all such overdue 
obligations have been satisfied.  
 
VII.  
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR FORWARD CAPACITY MARKETS  
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Any Lead Market Participant, including any Provisional Member that is a Lead Market Participant, 
transacting in the Forward Capacity Market that is otherwise required to provide additional financial 
assurance under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy (each a “Designated FCM 
Participant”), is required to provide additional financial assurance meeting the requirements of Section X 
below in the amounts described in this Section VII (such amounts being referred to in the ISO New 
England Financial Assurance Policy as the “FCM Financial Assurance Requirements”).  If the Lead 
Market Participant for a Resource changes, then the new Lead Market Participant for the Resource shall 
become the Designated FCM Participant.   
 
A.  
FCM Delivery Financial Assurance  
A Designated FCM Participant must include, for the Capacity Supply Obligation of each 
resource in its portfolio other than the Capacity Supply Obligation associated with any 
Energy Efficiency measures, FCM Delivery Financial Assurance in the calculation of its 
FCM Financial Assurance Requirements under the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy. If a Designated FCM Participant’s FCM Delivery Financial Assurance 
is negative, it will be used to reduce the Designated FCM Participant’s Financial 
Assurance Obligations (excluding FTR Financial Assurance Requirements), but not to 
less than zero.  FCM Delivery Financial Assurance is calculated according to the 
following formula: 
 
FCM Delivery Financial Assurance = [DFAMW x PE x max[(ABR – CWAP), 0.1] x SF] 
– IMC – MCC 
 
Where: 
MCC (monthly capacity charge) equals monthly capacity payments incurred in previous 
months, but not yet billed.  The MCC is estimated from the first day of the current 
delivery month until it is replaced by the actual settled MCC value when settlement is 
complete. 
 
IMC (intra-month collateral) equals estimated monthly capacity payments incurred 
during the current delivery month and, for each Designated FCM Participant, shall be 
updated three (3) days after publication of the most recent FCM Preliminary Capacity 
Performance Score report (or equivalent report) on the Market Information Server and 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
shall be limited by the monthly stop loss as described in Section III.13.7.3.1 of Market 
Rule 1. 
 
DFAMW (delivery financial assurance MW) equals the sum of the Capacity Supply 
Obligations of each resource in the Designated FCM Participant’s portfolio for the 
month, excluding the Capacity Supply Obligation of any resource that has reached the 
annual stop-loss as described in Section III.13.7.3.2 of Market Rule 1.  If the calculated 
DFAMW is less than zero, then the DFAMW will be set equal to zero. 
 
PE (potential exposure) is a monthly value calculated for the Designated FCM 
Participant’s portfolio as the difference between the Capacity Supply Obligation 
weighted average Forward Capacity Auction Starting Price and the Capacity Supply 
Obligation weighted average capacity price for the portfolio, excluding the Capacity 
Supply Obligation of any resource that has reached the annual stop-loss as described in 
Section III.13.7.3.2 of Market Rule 1.  The Forward Capacity Auction Starting Price shall 
correspond to that used in the Forward Capacity Auction corresponding to the current 
Capacity Commitment Period and the capacity prices shall correspond to those used in 
the calculation of the Capacity Base Payment for each Capacity Supply Obligation in the 
delivery month. 
 
In the case of a resource subject to a multi-year Capacity Commitment Period election 
made in a Forward Capacity Auction prior to the ninth Forward Capacity Auction as 
described in Sections III.13.1.1.2.2.4 and III.13.1.4.1.1.2.7 of Market Rule 1, the Forward 
Capacity Auction Starting Price shall be replaced with the applicable Capacity Clearing 
Price (indexed for inflation) in the above calculation until the multi-year election period 
expires.  
 
ABR (average balancing ratio) is the duration-weighted average of all of the system-wide 
Capacity Balancing Ratios calculated for each system-wide Capacity Scarcity Condition 
occurring in the relevant group of months in the three Capacity Commitment Periods 
immediately preceding the current Capacity Commitment Period and those occurring in 
the months within the relevant group that are prior to the current month of the current 
Capacity Commitment Period.  Three separate groups of months shall be used for this 
purpose: June through September, December through February, and all other months.  
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Until data exists to calculate this number, the temporary ABR for June through 
September shall equal 0.90; the temporary ABR for December through February shall 
equal 0.70; and the temporary ABR for all other months shall equal 0.60.  As actual data 
becomes available for each relevant group of months, calculated values for the relevant 
group of months will replace the temporary ABR values after the end of each group of 
months each year until all ABR values reflect actual data. 
 
CWAP (capacity weighted average performance) is the capacity weighted average 
performance of the Designated FCM Participant’s portfolio.  For each resource in the 
Designated FCM Participant’s portfolio, excluding any resource that has reached the 
annual stop-loss as described in Section III.13.7.3.2 of Market Rule 1, and excluding 
from the remaining resources the resource having the largest Capacity Supply Obligation 
in the month, the resource’s Capacity Supply Obligation shall be multiplied by the 
average performance of the resource.  The CWAP shall be the sum of all such values, 
divided by the Designated FCM Participant’s DFAMW.  If the DFAMW is zero, then the 
CWAP is set equal to one.   
 
The average performance of a resource is the Actual Capacity Provided during Capacity 
Scarcity Conditions divided by the product of the resource’s Capacity Supply Obligation 
and the equivalent hours of Capacity Scarcity Conditions in the relevant group of months 
in the three Capacity Commitment Periods immediately preceding the current Capacity 
Commitment Period and those occurring in the months within the relevant group that are 
prior to the current month of the current Capacity Commitment Period.  Three separate 
groups of months shall be used for this purpose: June through September, December 
through February, and all other months.  Until data exists to calculate this number, the 
temporary average performance for gas-fired steam generating resources, combined-cycle 
combustion turbines and simple-cycle combustion turbines shall equal 0.90; the 
temporary average performance for coal-fired steam generating resources shall equal 
0.85; the temporary average performance for oil-fired steam generating resources shall 
equal 0.65; the temporary average performance for all other resources shall equal 1.00.  
As actual data for each resource becomes available for each relevant group of months, 
calculated values for the relevant group of months will replace the temporary average 
performance values after the end of each group of months each year until all average 
performance values reflect actual data. The applicable temporary average performance 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
value will be used for new and existing resources until actual performance data is 
available.   
 
SF (scaling factor) is a month-specific multiplier, as follows: 
June and December 
2.000; 
July and January 
1.732; 
August and February 
1.414; 
All other months 
1.000. 
 
  
B.  
Non-Commercial Capacity  
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section VII to the contrary, a Designated FCM 
Participant offering Non-Commercial Capacity for a Resource that elected existing 
Resource treatment for the Capacity Commitment Period beginning June 1, 2010 will not 
be subject to the provisions of this Section VII.B with respect to that Resource (other than 
financial assurance obligations relating to transfers of Capacity Supply Obligations).  
 
1.  
FCM Deposit  
A Designated FCM Participant offering Non-Commercial Capacity into any upcoming 
Forward Capacity Auction must include in the calculation of its FCM Financial 
Assurance Requirements under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, 
beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after its qualification 
for such auction under Market Rule 1, an amount equal to $2/kW times the Non-
Commercial Capacity qualified for such Forward Capacity Auction by such Designated 
FCM Participant (the “FCM Deposit”).   
 
2.  
Non-Commercial Capacity in Forward Capacity Auctions  
a. 
Non-Commercial Capacity Participating in a Forward Capacity Auction Up 
 
To and Including the Eighth Forward Capacity Auction 
 
For Non-Commercial Capacity participating in a Forward Capacity Auction up to and including the 
eighth Forward Capacity Auction, a Designated FCM Participant that had its supply offer of Non-
Commercial Capacity accepted in a Forward Capacity Auction must include in the calculation of its 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Financial Assurance Requirement under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy the following 
amounts at the following times: 
(i) 
 beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day following 
announcement of the awarded supply offers in that Forward Capacity Auction, an amount 
equal to $5.737(on a $/kW-month basis) multiplied by the number of kW of capacity 
awarded to that Designated FCM Participant in that Forward Capacity Auction (such 
amount being referred to herein as the “Non-Commercial Capacity FA Amount”);   
(ii) 
beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the next 
annual Forward Capacity Auction after the Forward Capacity Auction in which such 
supply offer was awarded, an additional amount required to make the total amount 
included in the calculation of the Financial Assurance Requirement with respect to that 
Non-Commercial Capacity equal to two (2) times the Non-Commercial Capacity FA 
Amount; and  
(iii) 
beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the second 
annual Forward Capacity Auction after the Forward Capacity Auction in which such 
supply offer was accepted, an additional amount required to make the total amount 
included in the calculation of the Financial Assurance Requirement with respect to that 
Non-Commercial Capacity equal to three (3) times the Non-Commercial Capacity FA 
Amount.  
 
b. 
Non-Commercial Capacity Participating in the Ninth Forward Capacity 
 
Auction and All Forward Capacity Auctions Thereafter 
 
A Designated FCM Participant offering Non-Commercial Capacity into the ninth 
Forward Capacity Auction and all Forward Capacity Auctions thereafter must include in 
the calculation of its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements under the ISO New 
England Financial Assurance Policy, beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the tenth 
Business Day prior to the Forward Capacity Auction an amount equal to the difference 
between the Net CONE associated with the Forward Capacity Auction in which the 
Capacity Supply Obligation was awarded (adjusted as described in Section III.13.2.4) 
times the Non-Commercial Capacity qualified for such Forward Capacity Auction and 
the FCM Deposit. 
 
Upon completion of the Forward Capacity Auction, the Non-Commercial  
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Capacity Financial Assurance Amount shall be recalculated according to the following 
formula: 
 
Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount = (NCC x NCCFCA$ x 
Multiplier) + NCC Trading FA 
 
Where: 
NCC = the Capacity Supply Obligation awarded in the Forward Capacity Auction minus 
any Commercial Capacity  
 
For Capacity Supply Obligations acquired in Forward Capacity Auctions up to and 
including the thirteenth Forward Capacity Auction, NCCFCA$ = the Capacity Clearing 
Price from the first run of the auction-clearing process of the Forward Capacity Auction 
in which the Capacity Supply Obligation was awarded. For Capacity Supply Obligations 
acquired in the fourteenth Forward Capacity Auction and all Forward Capacity Auctions 
thereafter, NCCFCA$ = the Net CONE associated with the Forward Capacity Auction in 
which the Capacity Supply Obligation was awarded (adjusted as described in Section 
III.13.2.4). 
 
Multiplier = one at the completion of the Forward Capacity Auction in which the 
Capacity Supply Obligation was awarded; two beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the 
tenth Business Day prior to the next Forward Capacity Auction after the Forward 
Capacity Auction in which the Capacity Supply Obligation was awarded; and three 
beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the tenth Business Day prior to the second 
Forward Capacity Auction after the Forward Capacity Auction in which the Capacity 
Supply Obligation was awarded. 
 
In the case of Non-Commercial Capacity that fails to become commercial by the 
commencement of the Capacity Commitment Period associated with the Forward 
Capacity Auction in which it was awarded a Capacity Supply Obligation, the Non-
Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount shall be recalculated as follows: 
beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the first Business Day of the second month of the 
Capacity Commitment Period associated with the Forward Capacity Auction in which the 
Capacity Supply Obligation was awarded, the Multiplier in the recalculation of the Non-
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount shall be four.  The Multiplier in the 
recalculation of the Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount shall 
increase by one every six months thereafter until the Non-Commercial Capacity becomes 
commercial or the Capacity Supply Obligation is terminated.  
 
For Capacity Supply Obligations acquired in Forward Capacity Auctions up to and 
including the twelfth Forward Capacity Auction, NCC Trading FA = zero. For Capacity 
Supply Obligations acquired in the thirteenth Forward Capacity Auction and all Forward 
Capacity Auctions thereafter, NCC Trading FA shall be zero until the start of the 
applicable Capacity Commitment Period, at which time NCC Trading FA shall be 
calculated as described below, except that in no case shall NCC Trading FA be less than 
zero:   
(a) the total amount of NCC that has been shed (whether before or after the start 
of the Capacity Commitment Period) in any reconfiguration auctions or 
Capacity Supply Obligation Bilaterals or that is subject to a failure to cover 
charge pursuant to Section III.13.3.4(b) (but this total amount shall not be 
greater than NCC); multiplied by 
(b) the difference between: (x) the weighted average price at which the Capacity 
Supply Obligation was acquired in the Forward Capacity Auction (adjusted, 
where appropriate, in accordance with the Handy-Whitman Index of Public 
Utility Construction Costs); and (y) the weighted average price or failure to 
cover charge rate at which the Capacity Supply Obligation was shed or 
assessed, as applicable, except that for monthly Capacity Supply Obligation 
Bilaterals, one of the following prices will be used: 
(i) If the Designated FCM Participant does not certify to the ISO that it 
has not entered into any contract or other transaction with another 
party regarding the pricing of such Capacity Supply Obligation 
Bilateral (other than those to be settled by the ISO) that has the 
effect of deflating its NCC Trading FA, then the lower of: (1) the 
applicable monthly reconfiguration auction price, and (2) the 
Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral price shall be used; 
(ii) If the Designated FCM Participant provides the certification 
described in subsection (i) above, is the Capacity Transferring 
Resource, and is an Affiliate of the Capacity Acquiring Resource, 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
then the lower of: (1) the Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral 
price, and (2) the applicable Capacity Clearing Price (adjusted, 
where appropriate, in accordance with the Handy-Whitman Index of 
Public Utility Construction Costs) shall be used; or 
(iii) If neither subsection (i) nor (ii) applies, then the Capacity Supply 
Obligation Bilateral price shall be used. 
plus 
(c) the quantity of any Annual Reconfiguration Transactions associated with 
NCC for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period in which the Designated 
FCM Participant is the Capacity Transferring Resource (but this amount shall 
not be greater than NCC) multiplied by the difference between: (x) the 
applicable annual reconfiguration auction clearing price, and (y) the 
transaction price, which shall equal one of the following: 
(i) If the Designated FCM Participant does not certify to the ISO that it 
has not entered into any contract or other transaction with another 
party regarding the pricing of such Annual Reconfiguration 
Transaction (other than those to be settled by the ISO) that has the 
effect of deflating its NCC Trading FA, the transaction price shall 
be equal to the lower of: (1) the applicable annual reconfiguration 
auction clearing price, and (2) the applicable Annual 
Reconfiguration Transaction price; 
(ii) If the Designated FCM Participant provides the certification 
described in subsection (i) above, is the Capacity Transferring 
Resource, and is an Affiliate of the Capacity Acquiring Resource, 
then the transaction price shall be equal to the lower of: (1) the 
applicable Annual Reconfiguration Transaction price, and (2) the 
applicable Capacity Clearing Price (adjusted, where appropriate, in 
accordance with the Handy-Whitman Index of Public Utility 
Construction Costs); or 
(iii) If neither subsection (i) nor (ii) applies, then the applicable Annual 
Reconfiguration Transaction price shall be used. 
 
c. 
Non-Commercial Capacity Deferral 
 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Where the Commission approves a request to defer a Capacity Supply Obligation filed 
pursuant to Section III.13.3.7 of Market Rule 1, the Designated FCM Participant must 
include in the calculation of its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements under the ISO 
New England Financial Assurance Policy, beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) 30 days 
after Commission approval of the request to defer, an amount equal to the amount that 
would apply to a resource that has not achieved commercial operation one year after the 
start of a Capacity Commitment Period in which it has a Capacity Supply Obligation, as 
calculated pursuant to Section VII.B.2.a or Section VII.B.2.b, as applicable. 
 
3.  
Return of Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance  
Non-Commercial Capacity cleared in a Forward Capacity Auction up to and including 
the eighth Forward Capacity Auction that is declared commercial and has had its capacity 
rating verified by the ISO or otherwise becomes a Resource meeting the definition of 
Commercial Capacity, or that is declared commercial and had a part of its capacity rating 
verified by the ISO and the applicable Designated FCM Participant indicates no 
additional portions of that Resource will become commercial, that portion of the 
Resource shall no longer be considered Non-Commercial Capacity under the ISO New 
England Financial Assurance Policy and will instead become subject to the provisions of 
the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy relating to Commercial Capacity; 
provided that in either such case, the Designated FCM Participant will need to include in 
the calculation of its Financial Assurance Requirement an amount attributable to any 
remaining Non-Commercial Capacity.  
 
Once Non-Commercial Capacity associated with a Capacity Supply Obligation awarded 
in the ninth Forward Capacity Auction and all Forward Capacity Auctions thereafter 
becomes commercial, the Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount for 
any remaining Non-Commercial Capacity shall be recalculated according to the process 
outlined above for Non-Commercial Capacity participating in the ninth Forward Capacity 
Auction and all Forward Capacity Auctions thereafter. 
 
4.  
Credit Test Percentage Consequences for Provisional Members  
If a Provisional Member is required to provide additional financial assurance under the 
ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy solely in connection with (A) a supply 
offer of Non-Commercial Capacity into any Forward Capacity Auction and (B) its 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
obligation to pay Participant Expenses as a Provisional Member, and that Provisional 
Member is maintaining the amount of additional financial assurance required under the 
ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, then the provisions of Section III.B of the 
ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy relating to the consequences of that 
Market Participant’s Market Credit Test Percentage equaling 80 percent (80%) or 90 
percent (90%) shall not apply to that Provisional Member.  
 
C.  
[Reserved for Future Use]   
 
D.  
Loss of Capacity and Forfeiture of Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance  
If a Designated FCM Participant that has acquired Capacity Supply Obligations 
associated with Non-Commercial Capacity is in default under the ISO New England 
Financial Assurance Policy or the ISO New England Billing Policy and does not cure 
such default within the appropriate cure period,  or if a Designated FCM Participant is in 
default under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy or the ISO New England 
Billing Policy during the period between the day that is three Business Days before the 
FCM Deposit is required and the first day of the Forward Capacity Auction and does not 
cure such default within the appropriate cure period, then:  (i) beginning with the first 
Business Day following the end of such cure period that Designated FCM Participant will 
be assessed a default charge of one percent (1%) of its total Non-Commercial Capacity 
Financial Assurance Amount at that time for each Business Day that elapses until it cures 
its default; and (ii) if such default is not cured by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the sooner 
of (x) the fifth Business Day following the end of such cure period or (y) the second 
Business Day prior to the start of the next scheduled Forward Capacity Auction or annual 
reconfiguration auction or annual Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral submission (such 
period being referred to herein as the “Non-Commercial Capacity Cure Period”), then, in 
addition to the other actions described in this Section VII, (A) all Capacity Supply 
Obligations associated with Non-Commercial Capacity that were awarded to the 
defaulting Designated FCM Participant in previous Forward Capacity Auctions and 
reconfiguration auctions and that the defaulting Designated FCM Participant acquired by 
entering into Capacity Supply Obligation Bilaterals shall be terminated; (B) the 
defaulting Designated FCM Participant shall be precluded from acquiring any Capacity 
Supply Obligation that would be associated with Non-Commercial Capacity for which 
the defaulting Designated FCM Participant has submitted an FCM Deposit; (C) the ISO 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
will (1) draw down the entire amount of the FCM Deposit and the Non-Commercial 
Capacity Financial Assurance Amount associated with the terminated Capacity Supply 
Obligations and (2) issue an Invoice to the Designated FCM Participant if there is a 
shortfall resulting from that Designated FCM Participant’s failure to maintain adequate 
financial assurance hereunder or if the Designated FCM Participant used a Market Credit 
Limit to meet its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements; and (D) the default charges 
described in clause (i) above shall not be assessed to that Designated FCM Participant.  
All default charges collected under clause (i) above will be deposited in the Late Payment 
Account in accordance with the ISO New England Billing Policy.    
 
If a Designated FCM Participant’s Capacity Supply Obligation is terminated under 
Market Rule 1, the ISO will draw down the entire Non-Commercial Capacity Financial 
Assurance Amount provided by such Designated FCM Participant with respect to such 
terminated Capacity Supply Obligation.  If the Designated FCM Participant has not 
provided enough financial assurance to cover the amount due (or that would have been 
due but for the Designated FCM Participant’s positive Market Credit Limit) with respect 
to such Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount, then the ISO will issue 
an Invoice to the Designated FCM Participant for the amount due.  
 
E.  
Composite FCM Transactions  
For separate resources that seek to participate as a single composite resource in a Forward 
Capacity Auction in which multiple Designated FCM Participants provide that capacity 
(collectively, a “Composite FCM Transaction”), each Designated FCM Participant 
participating in that Composite FCM Transaction will be responsible for providing the 
financial assurance required as follows:  
 
1. 
the FCM Financial Assurance Requirements for each Designated FCM Participant shall 
be determined solely with respect to the capacity being provided, or sought to be 
provided, by that Designated FCM Participant;  
 
2. 
[reserved];  
 
3. 
if the Composite FCM Transaction involves one or more Resources seeking to provide or 
providing Non-Commercial Capacity, the Non-Commercial Capacity Financial 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Assurance Amount under Section VII.B for each Designated FCM Participant with 
respect to that Composite FCM Transaction will be calculated based on the commercial 
status of the Non-Commercial Capacity cleared through the Forward Capacity Auction;  
 
4. 
any Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount provided under Section 
VII.B by each Designated FCM Participant with respect to each Resource providing Non-
Commercial Capacity in the Composite FCM Transaction will  be recalculated according 
to Section VII.B.3 as the corresponding Resource becomes commercial; and  
 
5.  
in the event that the Capacity Supply Obligation is terminated, Section VII.D shall apply 
only to the Non-Commercial Capacity of the Designated FCM Participant participating in 
the Composite FCM Transaction that has failed to satisfy its obligations, and any Invoice 
issued thereunder will be issued only to that Designated FCM Participant.  
 
6. 
the FCM Delivery Financial Assurance calculated under Section VII.A for each 
Designated FCM Participant contributing resources to a Composite FCM Transaction 
shall be based on the Capacity Supply Obligation that is provided by that Designated 
FCM Participant in the current month of the Capacity Commitment Period, provided that 
the FCM charges incurred in previous months, but not yet paid, shall increase the FCM 
Financial Assurance Requirements only of the Designated FCM Participant that incurred 
the charges.   
 
F. 
Transfer of Capacity Supply Obligations 
 
1. 
Transfer of Capacity Supply Obligations in Reconfiguration Auctions 
A Designated FCM Participant that seeks to transfer its Capacity Supply Obligation in a 
reconfiguration auction must include in the calculation of its FCM Financial Assurance 
Requirements under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, prior to the close 
of bidding in that reconfiguration auction, the amounts described in subsections (a) and 
(b) below.  
 
 (a)  
For the 12 month period beginning with the current month, the sum of that Designated 
FCM Participant’s net monthly FCM charges for each month in which the net FCM 
revenue results in a charge. For purposes of this subsection (a), months in this period in 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
which that Designated FCM Participant’s net FCM revenue results in a credit are 
disregarded (i.e., the net credits from such months are not used to reduce the amount 
described in this subsection (a)) and the current month FCM charges are prorated to the 
proportion of remaining days in the month.  The amount described in this subsection (a), 
if any, will increase the Designated FCM Participant’s FCM Financial Assurance 
Requirements.  
(b)  
For the period including each month that is after the period described in subsection (a) 
above and that is included in a Capacity Commitment Period for which a Forward 
Capacity Auction has been conducted, the sum of that Designated FCM Participant’s net 
monthly FCM charges for each month in which the net FCM revenue results in a charge. 
For this period, the sum of such charges may be offset by net credits from months in 
which the net FCM revenue results in a credit, but in no case will the amount described in 
this subsection (b) be less than zero. The amount described in this subsection (b), if any, 
will increase the Designated FCM Participant’s FCM Financial Assurance Requirements.  
 
For purposes of these calculations, the net FCM revenue for a month shall be determined 
by accounting for all charges and credits related to the purchase or sale of Capacity 
Supply Obligations, demand bids and Annual Reconfiguration Transactions in the 
Forward Capacity Market, exclusive of any accrued Capacity Performance Payments on 
positions currently or previously held.  Upon the completion of each reconfiguration 
auction, the amount to be included in the calculation of any FCM Financial Assurance 
Requirements of that Designated FCM Participant shall be adjusted to reflect the cleared 
quantities at the zonal clearing price for all activity in that reconfiguration auction and 
accepted Annual Reconfiguration Transactions.    
 
2.  
Transfer of Capacity Supply Obligations in Capacity Supply Obligation Bilaterals  
A Designated FCM Participant that seeks to transfer its Capacity Supply Obligation in a 
Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral must include in the calculation of its FCM Financial 
Assurance Requirements under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, prior 
to the close of the period for submission of that Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral, 
amounts calculated as described in Section VII.F.1 above, as applicable.  If a Designated 
FCM Participant fails to provide the required additional financial assurance for its 
Capacity Supply Obligation Bilaterals, all of those transactions will be rejected.  If the 
Designated FCM Participant’s request to transfer a Capacity Supply Obligation in a 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Capacity Supply Obligation Bilateral is not accepted, it will no longer include amounts 
related to that Capacity Supply Obligation in the calculation of its FCM Financial 
Assurance Requirements.  
 
3. 
Financial Assurance for Annual Reconfiguration Transactions 
A Designated FCM Participant that submits an Annual Reconfiguration Transaction must 
include in the calculation of its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements under the ISO 
New England Financial Assurance Policy, prior to the close of the period for submission 
of that Annual Reconfiguration Transaction, amounts calculated as described in Section 
VII.F.1 above, as applicable.  If a Designated FCM Participant fails to provide the 
required additional financial assurance for its Annual Reconfiguration Transactions, all of 
those transactions will be rejected.  If a transaction is rejected, the Designated FCM 
Participant is no longer required to include amounts related to that transaction in the 
calculation of its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements.  
 
4. 
Substitution Auctions 
A Designated FCM Participant that participates in a substitution auction must include the following 
charges and credits in its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements. 
a. For any supply offer with at least one price-quantity pair priced less than zero must include in the 
calculation of its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements, beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on 
the tenth Business Day prior to the Forward Capacity Auction, amounts calculated as described in 
Section VII.F.1 above.  For purposes of these calculations, the maximum charge that would result 
from clearing any price-quantity pairs priced less than zero for each month of the Capacity 
Commitment Period associated with the Forward Capacity Auction shall be included in the 
amount calculated as described in Section VII.F.1(b) above, the net FCM revenue for all other 
months in the defined periods shall be determined by accounting for all charges and credits 
related to the purchase or sale of Capacity Supply Obligations in the Forward Capacity Market, 
and any accrued Capacity Performance Payments on positions currently or previously held are 
excluded. 
 
b. A Designated FCM Participant (i) that submits a demand bid into a substitution auction for a 
resource that is subject to a multi-year rate pursuant to Section III.13.1.3.5.4 or Section 
III.13.1.1.2.2.4, (ii) for which the maximum charge that would result from clearing the capacity 
subject to the multi-year rate election would exceed the revenue the Designated FCM Participant 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
will receive for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period under its multi-year rate election for 
the resource, (iii) must include in the calculation of its FCM Financial Assurance Requirements, 
beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the tenth Business Day prior to the Forward Capacity 
Auction, amounts calculated as described in Section VII.F.1 above.  For purposes of these 
calculations, the maximum charge that would result from clearing the capacity subject to the 
multi-year rate election shall be included in the amount calculated as described in Section 
VII.F.1(b) above, the net FCM revenue for all other months in the defined periods shall be 
determined by accounting for all charges and credits related to the purchase or sale of Capacity 
Supply Obligations in the Forward Capacity Market, and any accrued Capacity Performance 
Payments on positions currently or previously held are excluded. 
 
c. If a Designated FCM Participant is in default under the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy or the ISO New England Billing Policy beginning at 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the tenth 
Business Day prior to the Forward Capacity Auction and does not cure such default by the earlier 
of (i) the end of the appropriate cure period and (ii) 5 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the second Business 
Day prior to the start of the Forward Capacity Auction, then the defaulting Designated FCM 
Participant shall be precluded from submitting a supply offer or demand bid that is subject to this 
Section VII.F.4. 
 
d. Upon the completion of the substitution auction, the amount to be included in the calculation of 
the FCM Financial Assurance Requirements for a Designated FCM Participant as described in 
Section VII.F.1 above shall be adjusted to reflect all charges and credits related to the purchase or 
sale of Capacity Supply Obligations in the substitution auction. 
 
VIII.  [Reserved]  
 
  
IX.  
THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROTECTION  
The ISO shall obtain third-party credit protection, in the form of credit insurance coverage (“Credit 
Coverage”), on terms acceptable to the ISO in its reasonable discretion at least in an amount covering 
collectively the Credit Qualifying Rated Market Participants based on the formula below.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the entity providing such Credit Coverage cannot provide the amount 
required by this Section IX, the ISO will reduce the required coverage for all Credit Qualifying Rated 
Market Participants on a pro rata basis.  The total amount of the Credit Coverage shall be at least the 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
aggregate of the following formula; provided, however, if the entity providing the Credit Coverage denies 
coverage (in whole or in part) for any Credit Qualifying Rated Market Participant based on its rights 
under the insurance policy, the ISO will use reasonable efforts to obtain documentation regarding the 
denial and will make reasonable efforts to appeal such denial.  For each Credit Qualifying Rated Market 
Participant, the portion of the Credit Coverage shall be the lesser of: (A) the sum of (x) 2.5 times the 
average Hourly Charges for such Credit Qualifying Rated Market Participant within the previous fifty-
two calendar weeks plus (y) 2.5 times the sum of the average Non-Hourly Charges (excluding charges or 
credits related to FTR transactions) and the average Transmission Charges for such Credit Qualifying 
Rated Market Participant within the previous twelve calendar months; or (B) $50 million.  For any Credit 
Qualifying Rated Market Participant, the applicable amount of the Credit Coverage shall be adjusted 
monthly if the above formula produces a change that is either (A) 10% or greater, or (B) greater than 
$100,000.  The Credit Coverage shall be provided by an insurance company rated “A-” or better by A.M. 
Best & Co. or “A” or better by S&P.  The cost of the Credit Coverage obtained for each calendar year 
shall be allocated to all Credit Qualifying Rated Market Participants pro rata based, for each Credit 
Qualifying Rated Market Participant, on the average amount of the Invoices issued to that Credit 
Qualifying Rated Market Participant under the ISO New England Billing Policy in the preceding calendar 
year.  Each Credit Qualifying Rated Market Participant shall provide the ISO with such information as 
may be reasonably necessary for the ISO to obtain the Credit Coverage at the lowest possible cost.

ACCEPTABLE FORMS OF FINANCIAL ASSURANCE  
Provided that the requirements set forth herein are satisfied, acceptable forms of financial assurance 
include shares of registered or private mutual funds held in a shareholder account or a letter of credit, 
each in accordance with the provisions of this Section X. All costs associated with obtaining financial 
security and meeting the provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy are the 
responsibility of the Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer providing that 
security (each a “Posting Entity”).  Any Posting Entity requesting a change to one of the model forms 
attached to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy which would be specific to such Posting 
Entity (as opposed to a generic improvement to such form) shall, at the time of making that request, pay a 
$1,000 change fee, which fee shall be deposited into the Late Payment Account maintained under the ISO 
New England Billing Policy.   
 
A.  
Shares of Registered or Private Mutual Funds in a Shareholder Account  
Shares of registered or private mutual funds in a shareholder account are an acceptable 
form of financial assurance provided that the Posting Entity providing such collateral (i) 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
completes all required documentation to open an account with the financial institution 
selected by the ISO, after consultation with the NEPOOL Budget and Finance 
Subcommittee, (ii) completes and executes a security agreement (“Security Agreement”) 
in the form of Attachment 1 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy and is 
in compliance with the Security Agreement, and (iii) completes and executes a Control 
Agreement in the form posted on the ISO website and is in compliance with the Control 
Agreement.  Any material variation from the form of Security Agreement included in 
Attachment 1 to the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy or the form of Control 
Agreement posted on the ISO website must be approved by the ISO after consultation 
with the NEPOOL Budget and Finance Subcommittee and, in the case of the Security 
Agreement, filed with the Commission.  To the extent any amount of shares contained in 
the shareholder account is no longer required hereunder, the ISO shall return such 
collateral to the Posting Entity providing it within four (4) Business Days of a request to 
do so.  
 
If the amount of collateral maintained in the shareholder account is below the required 
level (including by reason of losses on investments), the Posting Entity shall immediately 
replenish or increase the amount to the required level.  The collateral will be held in an 
account maintained in the name of the Posting Entity and invested in the investment 
selected by that Posting Entity from a menu of investment options listed at the time on 
the ISO’s website, which menu will be approved by the NEPOOL Budget and Finance 
Subcommittee, with discounts applied to the investments in certain of such options if and 
as determined by the NEPOOL Budget and Finance Subcommittee. If a Posting Entity 
does not select an investment for its collateral, that collateral will be invested in the 
“default” investment option selected by the ISO and approved by the NEPOOL Budget 
and Finance Subcommittee from time to time.  Any dividends and distribution on such 
investment will accrue to the benefit of the Posting Entity.  The ISO may sell or 
otherwise liquidate such investments at its discretion to meet the Posting Entity’s 
obligations to the ISO.  In no event will the ISO or NEPOOL or any NEPOOL 
Participant have any liability with respect to the investment of collateral under this 
Section X.A.  
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an investment in shares of a registered fund in a 
shareholder account shall not be an acceptable form of financial assurance for a Posting 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Entity that is not a U.S. Person, as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended, unless the financial institution selected by the ISO allows such Posting 
Entity to invest in the investment options listed at the time on the ISO’s website or the 
Posting Entity is invested in the investment options listed on the ISO’s website as of 
March 19, 2015.  
 
B.  
Letter of Credit  
An irrevocable standby letter of credit provides an acceptable form of financial assurance 
to the ISO. For purposes of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, the letter 
of credit shall be valued at $0 at the end of the Business Day that is 30 days prior to the 
termination of such letter of credit.  If the letter of credit amount is below the required 
level, the Posting Entity shall immediately replenish or increase the letter of credit 
amount or obtain a substitute letter of credit.  The account party on a letter of credit must 
be either the Posting Entity whose obligations are secured by that letter of credit or an 
Affiliate of that Posting Entity.  
 
 
1. 
Requirements for Banks 
Each bank issuing a letter of credit that serves as financial assurance must meet the 
requirements of this Section X.B.1.  Each such bank must be on the ISO’s “List of 
Eligible Letter of Credit Issuers” which shall be established pursuant to this Section 
X.B.1.  The ISO will post the current List of Eligible Letter of Credit Issuers on its 
website, and update that List and posting no less frequently than quarterly; provided that 
if a bank is removed from the List of Eligible Credit Issuers, the ISO shall update the List 
and provide notice to the NEPOOL Budget & Finance Subcommittee.  To be included on 
the List of Eligible Letter of Credit Issuers, the bank must be organized under the laws of 
the United States or any state thereof, or be the United States branch of a foreign bank 
and either:  (i) be recognized by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) as an 
approved letter of credit bank; or (ii) have a minimum long-term debt rating (or, if the 
bank does not have minimum long-term debt rating, than a minimum corporate rating) of  
“A-” by S&P, or “A3” by Moody’s or “A-” by Fitch so long as its letter of credit is 
confirmed by a bank that is recognized by CME as an approved letter of credit issuer as 
described in clause (i) above; or (iii) have a minimum long-term debt rating (or, if the 
bank does not have minimum long-term debt rating, than a minimum corporate rating) of 
“A-” by S&P, or “A3” by Moody’s, or “A-” by Fitch and be approved by the ISO in its 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
sole discretion (the ISO will promptly advise the NEPOOL Budget and Finance 
Subcommittee of any additional bank approved by it under this provision).  Because the 
ratings described in clauses (ii) and (iii) are minimum ratings, a bank will not be 
considered to have satisfied the requirement of those clauses if any applicable rating from 
the Rating Agencies falls below the levels listed in those clauses.  In addition, no Posting 
Entity may provide a letter of credit that has been issued or confirmed by a bank that is an 
Affiliate of that Market Participant.  If a bank that is included on the List of Eligible 
Letter of Credit Issuers fails to satisfy any of the criteria set forth above or if the ISO 
determines in its sole discretion that despite satisfying any of the criteria set forth above, 
accepting a letter of credit from a bank on the List of Eligible Letter of Credit Issuers  
presents an unreasonable risk that a bank may fail to honor the terms of such letter of 
credit, the applicable Posting Entity will have five (5) Business Days from the date on 
which the ISO provides notice of such failure or removal to replace the letter of credit 
with a letter of credit from a bank satisfying those criteria or provide other financial 
assurance satisfying the requirements of the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy.  The ISO may extend that cure period to twenty (20) Business Days in its sole 
discretion.  The ISO must promptly advise the NEPOOL Budget and Finance 
Subcommittee of any extension of a cure period beyond five (5) Business Days under this 
provision.  No letter of credit bank may issue or confirm letters of credit under the ISO 
New England Financial Assurance Policy in an amount exceeding either:  (i) $100 
million in the aggregate for any single Posting Entity; or (ii) $150 million in aggregate 
for a group of Posting Entities that are Affiliates. If a bank is removed from the List of 
Eligible Letter of Credit Issuers based on the ISO’s determination that there is an 
unreasonable risk that a bank may fail to honor the terms of such letter of credit, the ISO 
in its sole discretion may reinstate eligibility, provided that the bank otherwise meets the 
conditions of this Section X.B.1. 
 
The following provisions shall apply when a bank fails to honor the terms of one or more 
letters of credit issued or confirmed by the bank in favor of the ISO: (i) if the bank fails to 
honor the terms of one letter of credit in a rolling seven hundred and thirty day period, 
then the ISO will issue a notice of such failure to the NEPOOL Budget and Finance 
Subcommittee, to all members and alternates of the Participants Committee, to the New 
England governors and utility regulatory agencies and to the billing and credit contracts 
for all Market Participants; (ii) if the bank fails to honor either the terms of one letter of 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
credit twice or the terms of  two letters of credit in a rolling seven hundred and thirty day 
period, then (A) the ISO shall issue a notice described in subsection (i) above, (B) the 
bank will no longer be eligible to issue or confirm letters of credit in favor of the ISO, (C) 
any letters of credit issued or confirmed by such bank in favor of the ISO will not be 
renewed, and (D) any letters of credit issued or confirmed by such bank in favor of the 
ISO must be replaced with another acceptable form of financial assurance within five (5) 
Business Days from the date on which the ISO provides notice of such failure (the ISO 
may extend that cure period to twenty (20) Business Days in its sole discretion).  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ISO in its sole discretion may reinstate eligibility after 
not less than two years from the loss of eligibility, provided that the bank otherwise meets 
the conditions of this Section X.B.1.  
 
Any letter of credit provided for a new Posting Entity for the purpose of covering the 
Initial Market Participant Financial Assurance Requirement must have a minimum term 
of 120 days.  
 
2. 
Form of Letter of Credit 
Attachment 2 provides a generally acceptable sample “clean” letter of credit, and all 
letters of credit provided by Posting Entities shall be in this form (with only minor, non-
material changes), unless a variation therefrom is approved by the ISO after consultation 
with the NEPOOL Budget and Finance Subcommittee and filed with the Commission.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Posting Entities that have provided a letter of credit in a 
form that was previously acceptable (e.g., under a prior version of Attachment 2) shall 
not be required to resubmit such letter of credit until the earlier of (a) the amendment or 
expiration of such letter of credit, in which case Posting Entity shall be required to 
provide a Letter of Credit in the Form of Attachment 2, or (b) December 31, 2021.  Any 
letter of credit provided for a new Posting Entity must have a minimum term of 120 days. 
All costs incurred by the ISO in collecting on a letter of credit provided under the ISO 
New England Financial Assurance Policy shall be paid, or reimbursed to the ISO, by the 
Posting Entity providing that letter of credit.  
 
C.  
Special Provisions for Provisional Members  
Notwithstanding any other provision of the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy to the contrary, due to the temporary nature of a Market Participant’s status as a 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Provisional Member and the relatively small amounts due from Provisional Members, 
any Provisional Member required to provide additional financial assurance under the ISO 
New England Financial Assurance Policy may only satisfy the portion of that 
requirement attributable to Participant Expenses under the RNA by providing a cash 
deposit in accordance with Section X.A.  Provisional Members will not have any other 
Non-Hourly Requirements under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy.  If a 
Provisional Member uses a standing instruction to pay its Invoices pursuant to the ISO 
New England Billing Policy, in order to avoid a default and/or a Late Payment Charge, 
the total amount of the cash deposited by that Provisional Member should be equal to the 
sum of (x) the Provisional Member’s Financial Assurance Requirement under the ISO 
New England Financial Assurance Policy that is attributable to Participant Expenses 
under the RNA and (y) the amount due from that Provisional Member on its next Invoice 
under that ISO New England Billing Policy (not including the amount of any 
Qualification Process Cost Reimbursement Deposit (including the annual true-up of that 
amount) due from such Provisional Member).  Provisional Members are also required to 
satisfy all other provisions of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, and any 
additional financial assurance required to be provided by a Provisional Member that is 
not attributable to Participant Expenses may be satisfied by providing a cash deposit or 
letter of credit in accordance with this Section X but shall not be satisfied through the 
provision of the cash deposit described in this Section X.C.  Without limiting or reducing 
in any way the requirements of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy that 
apply to a Provisional Member, the amount of the cash deposit initially provided by a 
Provisional Member that is attributable to Participant Expenses (including any amounts 
provided in connection with the standing instruction under the ISO New England Billing 
Policy described above) shall be at least $2,500, and each Provisional Member will 
replenish that cash deposit to at least that $2,500 level on December 31 of each year.  
 
XI.  
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  
 
A.  
Obligation to Report Material Adverse Changes  
Each Market Participant and each Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer is 
responsible for informing the ISO in writing within five (5) Business Days of any 
Material Adverse Change in its financial status.  A “Material Adverse Change” in 
financial status includes, but is not limited to, the following:  a downgrade to below an 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Investment Grade Rating by any Rating Agency; being placed on credit watch with 
negative implication by any Rating Agency if the Market Participant or Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer does not have an Investment Grade Rating; a 
bankruptcy filing or other insolvency; a report of a significant quarterly loss or decline of 
earnings; the resignation of key officer(s); the sanctioning of the Market Participant or 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer or any of its Principals imposed by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, any exchange monitored by the National 
Futures Association, or any state entity responsible for regulating activity in energy 
markets; the filing of a material lawsuit that could materially adversely impact current or 
future financial results; or a significant change in the Market Participant’s or Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer’s market capitalization.  A Market Participant’s or 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s failure to timely disclose a Material 
Adverse Change in its financial status may result in termination proceedings by the ISO.  
If the ISO determines that there is a Material Adverse Change in the financial condition 
of a Market Participant- or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer, then the ISO 
shall provide to that Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Customer a signed written notice two Business Days before taking any of the actions 
described below.  The notice shall explain the reasons for the ISO’s determination of the 
Material Adverse Change.  After providing notice, the ISO may take one or more of the 
following actions: (i) require that, within two Business Days of receipt of the notice of 
Material Adverse Change, the Market Participant or Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer provide one of the forms of financial assurance described in 
Section X of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy and/or an additional 
amount of financial assurance in one of the forms of financial assurance described in 
Section X of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy; (ii) require that the 
Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer cease one or more 
transactions in the New England Markets; or (iii) require that the Market Participant or 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer take other measures to restore the ISO’s 
confidence in its ability to safely transact in the New England Markets.  Any additional 
amount of financial assurance required as a result of a Material Adverse Change shall be 
sufficient, as reasonably determined by the ISO, to cover the Market Participant’s or 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s potential settled and unsettled liability 
or obligation, provided, however, that if the additional amount of financial assurance 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
required as a result of a Material Adverse Change is equal to or greater than $25 million, 
then the Chief Financial Officer shall first consult, to the extent practicable, with the 
ISO’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and General Counsel.  If the 
Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer fails to comply 
with any of the requirements imposed as a result of a Material Adverse Change, then the 
ISO may initiate termination proceedings against the Market Participant or Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer.  
 
B.  
Weekly Payments  
A Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer may request 
that, in lieu of providing the entire amount of one of the financial assurances set forth 
above to satisfy its Financial Assurance Requirement, a weekly billing schedule be 
implemented for its Non-Hourly Charges and its Transmission Charges.  The ISO may, in 
its discretion, agree to such a request; provided, however, that any weekly billing 
arrangement for Non-Hourly Charges and Transmission Charges will terminate no more 
than six (6) months after the date on which such arrangement begins unless the Market 
Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer requests an extension of 
such arrangement and demonstrates to the ISO’s satisfaction in its sole discretion that the 
termination of such arrangement and compliance with the other provisions of the ISO 
New England Financial Assurance Policy (including providing the full amount of its 
Financial Assurance Requirement) will impose a substantial hardship on the Market 
Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer.  Such demonstration of a 
substantial hardship shall be made every six (6) months after the initial demonstration, 
and a Market Participant’s or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s weekly 
billing arrangement for Non-Hourly Charges and Transmission Charges will be 
terminated if it fails to demonstrate to the ISO’s satisfaction in its sole discretion at any 
such six (6) month interval that compliance with the other provisions of the ISO New 
England Financial Assurance Policy will impose a substantial hardship on it. If the ISO 
agrees to implement a weekly billing schedule for Non-Hourly Charges and Transmission 
Charges for a Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer, the 
Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer shall be billed 
weekly for such Non-Hourly Charges and Transmission Charges in accordance with the 
ISO New England Billing Policy.  The Market Participant or Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer shall pay with respect to each weekly Invoice for Non-Hourly 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Charges and Transmission Charges an administrative fee, determined by the ISO, to 
reimburse the ISO for the costs it incurs as a result of that Market Participant’s or Non-
Market Participant Transmission Customer’s weekly billing arrangement.   
 
If a weekly billing schedule is implemented for a Market Participant’s or Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customer’s Non-Hourly Charges and Transmission Charges 
under this Section XI.B, the Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Customer may be required to provide the full amount of its Financial Assurance 
Requirement at any time if the Market Participant or Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer fails to pay when due any weekly Invoice.  In addition, upon the 
termination of a Market Participant’s or Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Customer’s weekly billing arrangement for Non-Hourly Charges and Transmission 
Charges, the Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer shall 
either satisfy the applicable rating requirements set forth herein, satisfy the Credit 
Threshold, or provide the full amount of one of the other forms of financial assurance set 
forth herein.  
 
C.  
Use of Transaction Setoffs  
In the event that a Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer 
has failed to satisfy its Financial Assurance Requirement hereunder, the ISO may retain 
payments due to such Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission 
Customer, up to the amount of such Market Participant’s or Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer’s unsatisfied Financial Assurance Requirement, as a cash deposit 
securing such Market Participant’s or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s 
obligations to the ISO, NEPOOL, the Market Participants, the PTOs and the Non-Market 
Participant Transmission Customers, provided, however, that a Market Participant or 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer will not be deemed to have satisfied its 
Financial Assurance Requirement under the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Policy because the ISO is retaining amounts due to it hereunder unless such Market 
Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer has satisfied all of the 
requirements of Section X with respect to such amounts.   
 
D.  
Reimbursement of Costs  
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Each Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer that fails to 
perform any of its obligations under the Tariff, including without limitation those arising 
under the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy and the ISO New England 
Billing Policy, shall reimburse the ISO, NEPOOL and each Market Participant, PTO and 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer for all of the fees, costs and expenses 
that they incur as a result of such failure.  
 
E.  
Notification of Default  
In the event that a Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer 
fails to comply with the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy (a “Financial 
Assurance Default”), such failure continues for at least two days and notice of that failure 
has not previously been given, the ISO may (but shall not be required to) notify such 
Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer in writing, 
electronically and by first class mail sent in each case to such Market Participant’s or 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s billing and credit contacts or such 
Market Participant’s member or alternate member on the Participants Committee (it 
being understood that the ISO will use reasonable efforts to contact all three where 
applicable), of such Financial Assurance Default.  Either simultaneously with the giving 
of the notice described in the preceding sentence or within two days thereafter (unless the 
Financial Assurance Default is cured during such period), the ISO shall notify each other 
member and alternate on the Participants Committee and each Market Participant’s and 
Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer’s billing and credit contacts of the 
identity of the Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer 
receiving such notice, whether such notice relates to a Financial Assurance Default, and 
the actions the ISO plans to take and/or has taken in response to such Financial 
Assurance Default.  In addition to the notices provided for herein, the ISO will provide 
any additional information required under the ISO New England Information Policy.  
 
F.  
Remedies Not Exclusive  
No remedy for a Financial Assurance Default is or shall be deemed to be exclusive of any 
other available remedy or remedies. Each such remedy shall be distinct, separate and 
cumulative, shall not be deemed inconsistent with or in exclusion of any other available 
remedy, and shall be in addition to and separate and distinct from every other remedy.  A 
Financial Assurance Default may result in suspension of the Market Participant or Non-
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Market Participant Transmission Customer or the commencement of termination 
proceedings by the ISO. 
 
G. 
Inquiries and Contests  
A Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer may request a 
written explanation of the ISO’s determination of its Market Credit Limit, Transmission 
Credit Limit, Financial Assurance Requirement or Transmission Obligations, including 
any change thereto, by submitting that request in writing to the ISO’s Credit Department, 
either by email at CreditDepartment@iso-ne.com or by facsimile at (413) 540-4569.  
That request must include the Market Participant’s customer identification number, the 
name of the Market Participant or Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer and 
the specific information for which the Market Participant or Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer would like an explanation and must be submitted by the 
designated credit contact for that Market Participant or Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer as on file with the ISO.  In addition, since Financial Assurance 
Requirements are updated at least daily, any request for an explanation relating to the 
calculation of, or a change in, a Financial Assurance Requirement must be submitted on 
the same day as that calculation or change.  The ISO’s response to any request under this 
Section XI.G shall include an explanation of how the applicable calculation or 
determination was performed using the formulas and criteria in the ISO New England 
Financial Assurance Policy.  A Market Participant or Non-Market Participant 
Transmission Customer may contest any calculation or determination by the ISO under 
the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy using the dispute resolution provisions 
of Section I.6 of the Tariff.  
  
H.  
Forward Contract/Swap Agreement  
All FTR transactions constitute “forward contracts” and/or “swap agreements” within the 
meaning of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), and the ISO 
shall be deemed to be a “forward contract merchant” and/or “swap participant” within the 
meaning of the Bankruptcy Code for purposes of those FTR transactions.  Pursuant to the 
ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy, the ISO Tariff and the Market Participant 
Service Agreement with each Market Participant, the ISO already has, and shall continue 
to have, the following rights (among other rights) in respect of a Market Participant 
default under those documents (including the ISO New England Financial Assurance 
Effective Date:  3/1/2024 – ER24-661-000 
Policy and the ISO New England Billing Policy):  A) the right to terminate and/or 
liquidate any FTR transaction held by that Market Participant; B) the right to 
immediately proceed against any additional financial assurance provided by that Market 
Participant; C) the right to set off any obligations due and owing to that Market 
Participant pursuant to any forward contract, swap agreement or similar agreement 
against any amounts due and owing by that Market Participant pursuant to any forward 
contract, swap agreement or similar agreement, such arrangement to constitute a “master 
netting agreement” within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code; and D) the right to 
suspend that Market Participant from entering into future transactions in the FTR system.  
For the avoidance of doubt, upon the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary 
proceeding for a Market Participant under the Bankruptcy Code, and without limiting any 
other rights of the ISO or obligations of any Market Participant under the Tariff 
(including the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy and the ISO New England 
Billing Policy) or any Market Participant Service Agreement, the ISO may exercise any 
of its rights against such Market Participant, including, without limitation 1) the right to 
terminate and/or liquidate any FTR transaction held by that Market Participant, 2) the 
right to immediately proceed against any additional financial assurance provided by that 
Market Participant, 3) the right to set off any obligations due and owing to that Market 
Participant pursuant to any forward contract, swap agreement and/or master netting 
agreement against any amounts due and owing by that Market Participant with respect to 
an FTR transaction including as a result of the actions taken by the ISO pursuant to 1) 
above, and 4) the right to suspend that Market Participant from entering into future 
transactions in the FTR system.
