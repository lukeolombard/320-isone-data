ISO-NE / NYISO List of Interconnection Facilities 
Version 1, dated: May 5, 2021 
There are three (3) ISO-NE / NYISO Interconnections, which are comprised of eight (8) 
alternating current (“AC”) Interties and one (1) high-voltage direct current (“HVDC”) Intertie.  
The first Interconnection (the “NY/NE Northern AC Interconnection”) is comprised of seven (7) 
of the eight (8) AC Interties.  The second Interconnection for the Northport-Norwalk Harbor 
Cable (the “NNC Interconnection”) is comprised of the remaining AC Intertie.  The third and 
final Interconnection for the Cross Sound Cable (the “CSC Interconnection”) is comprised of a 
single HVDC Intertie. 
 
List of Interconnections 
 
NY/NE Northern AC Interconnection - The NY/NE Northern AC Interconnection is comprised 
of the following seven (7) Interties (as ordered from North to South): 
1.   PV-20 Intertie (115 kV AC), 
2.   K7 Intertie (115 kV AC), 
3.   K6 Intertie (115 kV AC), 
4.   E205W Intertie (230 kV AC), 
5.   393 Intertie (345 kV AC),  
6.   690/FV Intertie (69 kV AC), and 
7.   398 Intertie (345 kV AC). 
 
NNC Interconnection - The Northport-Norwalk Harbor Cable (“NNC”) Interconnection is 
comprised of the following Intertie: 
1.   NNC Intertie (138 kV AC). 
 
CSC Interconnection - The Cross Sound Cable (“CSC”) Interconnection is comprised of the 
following Intertie: 
1.   CSC Intertie (150+/- kV HVDC). 
 
List of Interties (as ordered from North to South) 
PV-20 Intertie - A 115 kV AC transmission circuit, designated PV-20, series switched reactor 
and phase shifting transformers, connecting the Plattsburgh transmission substation in NY to the 
Sandbar transmission substation in VT.  The common meter point for this Intertie is located at 
the Plattsburgh transmission substation. 
K7 Intertie - A 115 kV AC transmission circuit, designated K7, and phase shifter transformer 
connecting the Whitehall transmission substation in NY to the Blissville transmission substation 
in VT.  The common meter point for this Intertie is located at the Whitehall transmission 
substation. 
K6 Intertie - A 115 kV AC transmission circuit, designated K6, connecting the Hoosick 
transmission substation in NY to the Bennington transmission substation in VT.  The common 
meter point for this Intertie is located at the Hoosick transmission substation. 
E205W Intertie - A 230 kV AC transmission circuit, designated E205W, connecting the Eastover 
Road transmission substation in NY to the Bear Swamp transmission substation in MA.  The 
common meter point for this Intertie is located at the Bear Swamp transmission substation. 
393 Intertie - A 345 kV AC transmission circuit, designated 393, connecting the Alps 
transmission substation in NY to the Berkshire transmission substation in MA.  The common 
meter point for this Intertie is located at the Alps transmission substation. 
690/FV Intertie - A 69 kV AC transmission circuit, designated 690/FV, connecting the 
Smithfield transmission substation in NY to the Salisbury transmission substation in CT.  The 
common meter point for this Intertie is located at the Salisbury transmission substation. 
398 Intertie - A 345 kV AC transmission circuit, designated 398, connecting the Cricket Valley 
transmission substation in NY to the Long Mountain transmission substation in CT.  The 
common meter point for this Intertie is located at the Cricket Valley transmission substation. 
NNC Intertie - Three 138 kV AC transmission circuits (designated 601, 602 and 603), 
transformer and phase shifting transformer, initially designated as the 1385 Cable Intertie and 
now the NNC Intertie, connecting the Northport transmission substation in NY to the Norwalk 
Harbor transmission substation in CT.1  The common meter point for this Intertie is located at 
the Norwalk Harbor transmission substation. 
CSC Intertie - A 150+/- kV HVDC transmission circuit and associated converter facilities, 
designated CSC, connecting the Tomson converter at Shoreham, NY to the Halvarsson converter 
at New Haven, CT.  This entire facility is under ISO-NE operating authority, pursuant to the 
FERC Order containing approvals regarding the HVDC Cross Sound Cable.  For Operational 
Control purposes, the point of demarcation for the HVDC Interconnection CSC is within New 
York State at the point where the converter facilities interconnect with LIPA’s 138 kV AC 
facilities at Shoreham, NY.  The common meter point for this Intertie is located at the Shoreham 
transmission substation.
