II.A. 
COMMON SERVICE PROVISIONS 
 
 
II.1  
Definitions  
Whenever used in this OATT, in either the singular or plural number, capitalized terms shall have the 
meanings specified in Section I of the Tariff.  Terms used in this OATT that are not defined in Section I 
shall have the meanings customarily attributed to such terms by the electric utility industry in New England 
or as defined elsewhere in the ISO New England Filed Documents. 
 
 
II.2  
Purpose of This OATT  
Non-discriminatory open-access transmission service over the New England Transmission System is 
provided by the ISO under the terms and conditions of this OATT. Ancillary Services will be supplied by 
the ISO in accordance with Section II.4 of this OATT.  The ISO acts as Counterparty for sales to its 
Customers of Regional Transmission Service and Ancillary Services, and as Counterparty with suppliers of 
Ancillary Services.  The ISO offers Regional Transmission Service, as made available to the ISO under the 
terms of the TOA for provision to its Customers, at the rates established by the PTOs.  Where Ancillary 
Services are initially supplied to the ISO by Market Participants for provision to the ISO’s Customers, the 
ISO pays to or charges its Market Participants or Customers (as applicable) the amounts produced by the 
pertinent market clearing process or through the other pricing mechanisms described in the Tariff.  
 
This OATT is intended to provide for comparable, non-discriminatory treatment of all similarly situated 
Transmission Owners, Qualified Transmission Project Sponsors and all Transmission Customers, and it 
shall be construed in the manner which best achieves this objective.  
 
This OATT provides for a two-tier transmission arrangement integrating regional service which is provided 
by the ISO under this OATT, and Local Service which is provided by the PTOs under Schedule 21 of this 
OATT.  
 
 
 
II.3  
Market Rule 1  
This OATT is intended to provide for transmission service in conjunction with the Standard Market Design 
as provided for in Market Rule 1. The provisions of Market Rule 1 are incorporated by reference as a part of 
this OATT, and shall apply to all entities that receive service under this OATT.  
 
 
 
II.4

Markets pursuant to Market Rule 1 is required to acquire these Ancillary Services, whether from the ISO, 
from a third party, or by self-supply.  
 
A Transmission Customer may not decline the ISO’s offer of these Ancillary Services unless the 
Transmission Customer demonstrates to the ISO that the Transmission Customer has acquired Ancillary 
Services of equal quality from another source. The Transmission Customer that is not a Market Participant 
must list in its Application which Ancillary Services it will purchase from the ISO. 
 
Ancillary Services for (a) MTF shall be charged and paid for in accordance with Schedule 18 of the OATT; 
(b) OTF shall be charged and paid for in accordance with Schedule 20 of the OATT; and (c) Local Services 
shall be charged and paid for in accordance with Schedule 21.

Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS)  
Terms and conditions regarding the ISO Open Access Same-Time Information System and standards of 
conduct are set forth in 18 C.F.R. §37 of the Commission’s regulations (Open Access Same-Time 
Information System and Standards of Conduct for Public Utilities) and 18 C.F.R. §38 of the Commission’s 
regulations (Business Practice Standards and Communications Protocols for Public Utilities). Information 
concerning  
 
(i) available transfer capability, (ii) transmission rates and (iii) System Conditions that may give rise to 
interruptions or Curtailments shall be made available to all Transmission Customers through the OASIS on 
a timely and non-discriminatory basis. Transmission Owners and/or the Schedule 20A Service Providers 
shall make available to the ISO the information required to permit the maintenance of the OASIS in 
compliance with Commission Order 889 and any other applicable Commission orders; provided that no 
Transmission Owner and/or the Schedule 20A Service Providers shall be required to furnish information 
which is required to be treated as confidential in accordance with the ISO policy without appropriate 
arrangements to protect the confidentiality of such information. In the event available transfer capability, as 
posted on OASIS, is insufficient to accommodate a request for the interconnection of a new or materially 
changed generating unit or a new or materially changed interconnection to another Control Area or new 
Regional Network Service or new Local Service or an Elective Transmission Upgrade, additional studies 
may be required as provided by this OATT pursuant to Sections II.19, II.34, and II.47 and Schedule 21. The 
ISO shall maintain a single OASIS that is applicable to the entire region. Transmission service offered over 
the New England Transmission System shall be administered under this RTO-wide OASIS node and 
associated business procedures. Transmission service offered over MTF or OTF shall be administered 
under this RTO-wide OASIS node (and associated business procedures) in accordance with the associated 
operating agreement and/or service administration agreement, OATT Schedules and business procedures.  
 
The ISO, Transmission Owners, and Schedule 20A Service Providers shall post on OASIS and their public 
websites an electronic link to all rules, standards and practices that (i) relate to the terms and conditions of 
transmission service, (ii) are not subject to a North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) copyright 
restriction, and (iii) are not otherwise included in this Tariff. The ISO, Transmission Owners, and Schedule 
20A Service Providers shall post on OASIS and on their public website an electronic link to the NAESB 
website where any rules, standards and practices that are protected by copyright may be obtained. The ISO, 
Transmission Owners, and Schedule 20A Service Providers shall also post on OASIS and on their public 
website an electronic link to a statement of the process by which they shall add, delete or otherwise modify 
 
 
the rules, standards and practices that are not included in this Tariff. Such process shall set forth the means 
by which the ISO, Transmission Owners, and Schedule 20A Service Providers shall provide reasonable 
advance notice to Transmission Customers and Eligible Customers of any such additions, deletions or 
modifications, the associated effective date, and any additional implementation procedures that the ISO, 
Transmission Owners, and Schedule 20A Service Providers deem appropriate.  
 
 
 
II.6  
Local Furnishing and Other Tax-Exempt Bonds  
 
II.6.1  Transmission Owners That Own Facilities Financed by Local Furnishing or Other 
Tax-Exempt Bonds: This provision is applicable only to Transmission Owners that have financed 
facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy with tax-exempt bonds, as described in Section 142(f) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (“local furnishing bonds”) or other tax-exempt bonds, as described in Section 
103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (“other tax-exempt bonds”). Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this OATT, the ISO shall not be required to provide service to any Eligible Customer pursuant to this OATT 
if the provision of such transmission service would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of any local furnishing 
bond(s) or other tax-exempt bonds used to finance the Transmission Owner’s facilities that would be used 
in providing such transmission service.  
 
II.6.2  Alternative Procedures for Requesting Transmission Service -Local Furnishing Bonds: If a 
Transmission Owner determines that the provision of transmission service to be provided under this OATT 
would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of any local furnishing bond(s) used to finance the Transmission 
Owner’s facilities that would be used in providing such transmission service, the ISO shall be advised 
within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Completed Application by an Eligible Customer requesting such 
service, or the date on which this OATT becomes effective, whichever is applicable.  
 
If an Eligible Customer thereafter renews its request for the same transmission service referred to above in 
this Section II.6.2 by tendering an application under Section 211 of the Federal Power Act, the 
Transmission Owner, within ten days of receiving a copy of the Section 211 application, will waive its 
rights to receive a request for service under Section 213(a) of the Federal Power Act and to the issuance of 
a proposed order under Section 212(c) of the Federal Power Act. The Commission, upon receipt of the 
Transmission Owner’s waiver of its rights to a request for service under Section 213(a) of the Federal 
Power Act and to the issuance of a proposed order under Section 212(c) of the Federal Power Act, shall 
issue an order under Section 211 of the Federal Power Act. Upon issuance of the order under Section 211 of 
the Federal Power Act, the Transmission Owner shall be required to provide the requested transmission 
service in accordance with the terms and conditions of this OATT.  
 
II.6.3  Alternative Procedures for Requesting Transmission Service – Other Tax-Exempt Bonds: If 
a Transmission Owner determines that the provision of transmission service to be provided under the 
OATT would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of any other tax-exempt bonds used to finance the 
 
 
Transmission Owner’s facilities that would be used in furnishing such transmission service, it shall notify 
the ISO within thirty (30) days of the date on which this OATT becomes effective, and shall elect in its 
notice either to comply with the procedure specified in Section II.6.2 or to make its facilities unavailable 
under the OATT and thereby waive its right to share in the distribution of revenues received under the 
OATT derived from such facilities. Any such election may be changed at any time. 
 
 
 
II.7  
Reciprocity  
A Transmission Customer receiving transmission service under this OATT, including transmission service 
under Local Service Schedules, agrees to provide comparable transmission service that it is capable of 
providing to the Market Participants, Transmission Owners and/or the Schedule 20A Service Providers, and 
their distribution Affiliates on similar terms and conditions over facilities used for the transmission of 
electric energy in Canada or used for such transmission in the United States and that are owned, controlled 
or operated by, or on behalf of the Transmission Customer and over facilities used for the transmission of 
electric energy owned, controlled or operated by the Transmission Customer’s corporate Affiliates. 
Transmission of power on the Transmission Customer’s system to the border of the New England Control 
Area and transfer of ownership at that point shall not satisfy, or relieve the Transmission Customer of, the 
obligation to provide reciprocal service. This reciprocity requirement applies not only to the Transmission 
Customer that obtains transmission service under the OATT, but also to all parties to a transaction that 
involves the use of transmission service under the OATT, including the power seller, buyer and any 
intermediary, such as a power marketer. This reciprocity requirement also applies to any Transmission 
Customer that owns, controls or operates transmission facilities that uses an intermediary, such as a power 
marketer, to request transmission service under the OATT. If the Transmission Customer does not own, 
control or operate transmission facilities, the Transmission Customer must include in its Application a 
sworn statement of one of its duly authorized officers or other representatives that the purpose of its 
Application is not to assist an Eligible Customer to avoid the requirements of this provision.  
Effective Date:  7/9/24 – Docket No. ER24-1978-000 
 
II.8  
Billing and Invoicing; Accounting  
 
II.8.1  Billing Procedure: Billings to Transmission Customers shall be made in accordance with this 
Section II.8, Schedules 18, 20 and 21 and the ISO New England Billing Policy, as applicable, and as may 
be supplemented by other billing procedures established pursuant to the TOA, a MTOA or an OTOA, as 
applicable.  
 
II.8.2  Invoicing: Invoicing and payments are addressed in Attachments L1, L2, L3 and L4 to Section II 
of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
II.8.3  Interest on Unpaid Balances: Interest on any unpaid amounts (including amounts placed in 
escrow) will be calculated in accordance with the methodology specified for interest on refunds in 18 
C.F.R. §35.19a(a)(2)(iii) of the Commission’s regulations. Interest on delinquent amounts will be 
calculated from the due date of the bill to the date of payment. Payments must be made by Electronic 
Funds Transfer or in immediately available funds.  
 
II.8.4  Customer Default: In the event a Transmission Customer fails to make payment to the ISO for 
services under this OATT, other than under Schedules 18, 20 and 21 of this OATT, on or before the due 
date as described above, and such failure of payment is not corrected within thirty (30) calendar days after 
the ISO notifies the Transmission Customer to cure such failure, a default by the Transmission Customer 
will be deemed to exist under this OATT.  Additional default provisions may apply as stated under the 
ISO New England Billing Policy, Exhibit ID to Section I of the Transmission, Markets and Services 
Tariff. Upon the occurrence of a default under this OATT, the ISO may initiate a proceeding with the 
Commission to terminate service but shall not terminate service until the Commission approves such 
termination. In the event of a billing dispute between the ISO and the Transmission Customer, service 
will continue to be provided under a Service Agreement, and service termination proceedings will not be 
initiated as long as the Transmission Customer continues to make all payments invoiced by the ISO, 
including any disputed amounts, subject to resolution of such dispute in favor of such Transmission 
Customer. If the Transmission Customer fails to meet this requirement for continuation of service, then 
the ISO may provide notice to the Transmission Customer of the ISO’s intention to suspend service in 
sixty days, in accordance with applicable Commission rules and regulations, and may proceed with such 
suspension.

II.11  Nature of Regional Network Service  
Regional Network Service is the service over the PTF pursuant to Part II.B of this OATT which is provided 
by the ISO to Network Customers to serve their loads. It includes transmission service over the PTF for the 
delivery to a Network Customer of its energy and capacity in Network Resources and delivery to or by 
Network Customers of energy and capacity in Market transactions.  
 
When a Real-Time External Transaction purchase is submitted by the Transmission Customer and is 
scheduled in the Real-Time Energy Market, the submission shall be deemed a request for Regional 
Network Service and the ISO shall generate a reservation for the transmission service over the PTF equal to 
the transaction’s maximum scheduled flow during the operating hour. This reservation amount shall be the 
basis for the Reserved Capacity. Each Transmission Customer which has a Regional Network Load within 
or outside of the New England Control Area shall pay for Regional Network Service under the terms of 
Section II.B of this OATT.  
 
 
 
II.B.  REGIONAL NETWORK SERVICE  
Regional Network Service will be provided by the ISO to Transmission Customers pursuant to the 
applicable terms and conditions of this OATT. Local Network Service will be provided pursuant to the 
applicable terms and conditions of Schedule 21 of this OATT.  
 
 
 
II.12  Availability of Regional Network Service  
 
II.12.1 Provision of Regional Network Service: Regional Network Service shall be available to each 
Eligible Customer.  
 
II.12.2 Eligibility to Receive Regional Network Service: Regional Network Service shall be taken and 
paid for by each Eligible Customer which has a load within the New England Control Area unless the 
Eligible Customer operates its own Control Area. Transmission Customers which take Regional Network 
Service must also take Local Network Service except as otherwise provided in Section II.40 of this OATT. 
The Local Network Service shall provide:  
 
(a)  
for a pro rata allocation of monthly revenue requirements not otherwise paid for through 
charges to Eligible Customers for Local Point-to-Point Service among the PTO’s Network 
Customers receiving service under the Local Service Schedule on the basis of their loads 
during the hour in the month in which the total connected load to the Local Network is at its 
maximum, without any adjustment for credits for generation;  
 
(b)  
for the recovery under the Local Service Schedule from Eligible Customers taking 
Regional Network Service of that portion of the PTO’s annual transmission revenue 
requirements with respect to PTF which is not recovered through the distribution of 
revenues from Regional Network Service;  
 
(c)  
that where all or a part of the load of Transmission Customers taking service under this 
OATT is connected directly to PTF, the Transmission Customers receiving the service 
shall have no obligation to pay charges for service across Non-PTF transmission facilities 
with respect to that portion of the connected load after the Transition Period, but shall 
continue to pay its share of any other Local Network Service costs directly associated with 
the PTF-connected load; provided that in the event of any inconsistency between the 
foregoing provisions and the terms of any Excepted Transaction which is listed in 
Attachment G-1 to this OATT, the Excepted Transaction shall control: 
 
(d) 
that if the PTO receives a distribution out of revenues paid for Through or Out Service, the 
amounts received shall reduce its Local Network Service revenue requirements; and 
 
 
 
(e)   
that if the PTO receives transmission revenues from a Transmission Customer taking Local 
Network Service from the PTO with respect to an Excepted Transaction, the amounts 
received shall reduce the amount due from such Transmission Customer connected to the 
PTO’s transmission system for Local Network Service provided thereto by the PTO rather 
than reducing the PTO’s total cost of service.

II.15  Nature of Regional Network Service
II.15.1 Scope of Service: Regional Network Service is the transmission service described above that
allows Network Customers to efficiently and economically utilize their resources and Interchange 
Transactions to serve their Regional Network Load located in the New England Control Area and any 
additional load that may be designated pursuant to Section II.18.3 of this OATT. The Network Customer 
taking Regional Network Service must obtain or provide Ancillary Services pursuant to Section II.4 of this 
OATT.  
II.15.2 ISO and PTO Responsibilities: As provided in the TOA and this OATT, the ISO and the PTOs
will plan, construct, operate and maintain the PTF in accordance with Good Utility Practice and their 
planning obligations in Attachment K in order to allow the ISO to provide the Network Customer with 
Regional Network Service over the PTF. Each PTO, on behalf of its Native Load Customers, shall be 
required to designate resources and loads in the same manner as any Network Customer under Part II.B of 
this OATT. This information must be consistent with the information used by the ISO to calculate available 
transfer capability. The PTOs and the ISO as applicable and in accordance with the TOA shall include the 
Network Customer’s Regional Network Load in PTF planning and shall, consistent with Good Utility 
Practice and Attachment K, endeavor to construct and place into service sufficient transfer capability to 
deliver Network Resources to serve the Network Customer’s Regional Network Load on a basis 
comparable to the PTOs’ delivery of their own generating and purchased resources to their Native Load 
Customers.  
II.15.3 Real Power Losses: Real power losses are associated with all transmission service. Neither the ISO
nor the Transmission Owners nor the Schedule 20A Service Providers are obligated to provide real power 
losses. The cost of PTF losses shall be recovered through the Loss Component of the Locational Marginal 
Prices provided for in ISO New England Operating Documents.  
II.15.4 Restrictions on Use of Service: The Network Customer is entitled to use Regional Network
Service for any of the uses specified in Part II.B of this OATT.

been filed), will be sent to the Eligible Customer. If an Application fails to meet the 
requirements of this section, the ISO shall notify the Eligible Customer requesting service 
within fifteen (15) days of receipt and specify the reasons for such failure. Wherever possible, 
the ISO will attempt to remedy deficiencies in the Application through informal 
communications with the Eligible Customer. If such efforts are unsuccessful, the ISO shall 
return the Application without prejudice to the Eligible Customer, who may thereafter file a 
new or revised Application that fully complies with the requirements of this section. The 
Eligible Customer will be assigned a new reservation priority consistent with the date of the 
new or revised Application. The ISO shall treat this information consistent with the standards 
of conduct contained in Part 37 of the Commission’s regulations.  
II.16.3 Technical Arrangements to be Completed Prior to Commencement of Service: Regional
Network Service shall not commence until the PTO, the Network Customer, or a third party, have 
completed installation of all equipment specified by the ISO consistent with Good Utility Practice and any 
additional requirements reasonably and consistently imposed to ensure the reliable operation of the PTF. 
The PTO and the ISO shall exercise reasonable efforts, in coordination with the Network Customer, to 
complete such arrangements as soon as practicable taking into consideration the Service Commencement 
Date.  
II.16.4 Network Customer Facilities: The provision of Regional Network Service shall be conditioned
upon the Network Customer’s constructing, maintaining and operating the facilities on its side of each Point 
of Delivery or interconnection necessary to reliably deliver capacity and energy from the PTF to the 
Network Customer. The Network Customer shall be solely responsible for constructing or installing and 
operating and maintaining all facilities on the Network Customer’s side of each such Point of Delivery or 
interconnection.  
II.16.5 Filing of Transmission Service Agreement: The ISO will file Service Agreements for Regional
Network Service with the Commission in compliance with applicable Commission regulations. 
 
 
 
II.17  Network Resources  
 
II.17.1 Designation of Network Resources: The designation of generation resources as Network 
Resources shall be effected automatically in accordance with the definition thereof for Market Participant 
and as required within the MPSA. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, a Network Customer shall 
designate to the ISO those Network Resources which are owned, purchased or leased by it. The Network 
Resources so designated may not include resources, or any portion thereof, that are committed for sale to 
non-designated third party load or otherwise cannot be called upon to meet the Network Customer’s 
Regional Network Load on a non-interruptible basis. Any owned, purchased or leased resources that were 
serving the Network Customer’s loads under firm agreements entered into on or before the Compliance 
Effective Date shall be deemed to continue to be so owned, purchased or leased by it until the Network 
Customer informs the ISO of a change.  
 
II.17.2 Designation of New Network Resources: The Network Customer shall identify to the ISO (and 
the PTO, as applicable) with as much advance notice as practicable any new (or modification to existing) 
Network Resources which are owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer. A designation of a 
Network Resource as owned, purchased or leased by the Transmission Customer must be made by a notice 
to the ISO and the PTO, as applicable.  
 
II.17.3 Termination of Network Resources: The Network Customer may terminate the designation of all 
or part of a Network Resource as owned, purchased or leased by it at any time but should provide 
notification to the ISO and the affected Transmission Owner(s) or the Schedule 20A Service Provider as 
soon as reasonably practicable.  
 
II.17.4 Network Customer Redispatch Obligation: As a condition to receiving Regional Network 
Service, the Network Customer agrees to redispatch its Network Resources as requested by the ISO 
pursuant to Section II.20.2 of this OATT. The ISO will redispatch all Resources subject to its control, 
pursuant to ISO New England Operating Documents, in order to meet load and to accommodate Real-Time 
External Transactions. Transmission Customers will be charged for the Congestion Costs and any other 
costs associated with such redispatch in accordance with ISO New England Operating Documents.  
 
II.17.5 Transmission Arrangements for Network Resources Not Physically Interconnected With The 
PTF: The Network Customer shall be responsible for any arrangements necessary to deliver capacity and 
 
 
energy from a Network Resource not physically interconnected with the PTF. The ISO will undertake 
reasonable efforts to assist the Network Customer in obtaining such arrangements, including without 
limitation, providing any information or data required by such other entity pursuant to Good Utility 
Practice.  
 
II.17.6 Limitation on Designation of Resources: The Network Customer must demonstrate that it owns, 
leases or has committed to purchase an Ownership Share in a generation resource pursuant to an executed 
contract in order to designate the generating resource to serve its Regional Network Load. Alternatively, the 
Network Customer may establish that execution of a contract is contingent upon the availability of 
transmission service under Part II.B of this OATT. An Ownership Share in a generating unit within the New 
England Control Area which is placed in service after the Compliance Effective Date (other than a unit 
which has lost its capacity value when its capacity value is restored or a deactivated unit which may be 
reactivated without satisfying the requirements of Section II.46 of the OATT in accordance with the 
provisions thereof) may not be designated to serve a Network Customer’s load unless, and only to the extent 
that, it has been determined to be integrated into the PTF in accordance with Section II.46 of this OATT.  
 
II.17.7 Use of Interface Capacity by the Network Customer: There is no limitation upon a Network 
Customer’s use of the PTF at any particular interface to integrate the Network Customer’s resources (or 
substitute purchases in Interchange Transactions) with its Regional Network Loads. However, a Network 
Customer’s use of the ISO total interface capacity, between the New England Control Area and a 
neighboring control area, to serve its Regional Network Load may not exceed the transfer capability of that 
interface.  
 
 
 
II.18  Designation of Regional Network Load  
 
II.18.1 Regional Network Load: The Network Customer must designate the individual Regional Network 
Loads to which it expects to have served through Regional Network Service.  
 
II.18.2 Regional Network Load Located Within the New England Control Area: The Network 
Customer shall provide the ISO and the affected Transmission Owner(s) with as much advance notice as 
reasonably practicable of the designation of Regional Network Load that is located within the New England 
Control Area and that will be directly or indirectly receiving service over the PTF. A designation of new 
Regional Network Load must be made through a modification of service pursuant to a new Application. 
The PTOs will use due diligence to install or cause to be installed any transmission facilities required to 
interconnect a new Regional Network Load designated by the Network Customer. The costs of new 
facilities required to interconnect a new Regional Network Load shall be determined in accordance with the 
procedures provided in Section II.19.4 of this OATT and shall be charged to the Network Customer in 
accordance with Commission policy and Schedules 11 and 12 to this OATT.  
 
II.18.3 Regional Network Load Located Outside the New England Control Area): This section applies 
to both initial designation pursuant to Section II.18.1 of this OATT and the subsequent addition of new 
Regional Network Load not physically interconnected with the PTF. To the extent that the Network 
Customer desires to obtain transmission service for a load outside the New England Control Area, the 
Network Customer shall have the option of (1) electing to include the entire load as Regional Network Load 
for all purposes under Part II.B of this OATT and designating resources to serve such additional Regional 
Network Load, or (2) excluding that entire load from its Regional Network Load. To the extent that the 
Network Customer gives notice of its intent to add a new Regional Network Load as part of its Regional 
Network Load pursuant to this section the request must be made through a modification of service pursuant 
to a new Application, and shall be available only so long as a scheduling and interconnection agreement 
acceptable to the ISO shall be required to be in effect with (a) the Control Area in which the load is located 
and (b) any control areas that are providing transmission service between the control area in which the load 
is located and the ISO. Charges for such portion of the service shall be the applicable Through or Out 
Service rate as determined under Section II.25 of this OATT times the amount reserved for the Regional 
Network Load which is not physically interconnected with the PTF.  
 
 
 
II.18.4 New Interconnection Points: To the extent the Network Customer desires to add a new Point of 
Delivery or interconnection point between the PTF and a Regional Network Load, the Network Customer 
shall provide the ISO with as much advance notice as reasonably practicable.  
 
II.18.5 Changes in Service Requests: Under no circumstances shall the Network Customer’s decision to 
cancel or delay a requested change in Regional Network Service (the addition of a new Network Resource, 
if any, or designation of a new Regional Network Load) in any way relieve the Network Customer of its 
obligation to pay the costs of transmission facilities constructed by the PTOs and charged to the Network 
Customer as reflected in the applicable Transmission Service Agreement or other appropriate agreement. 
However, the ISO must treat any requested change in Regional Network Service in a non-discriminatory 
manner.  
 
II.18.6 Annual Load and Resource Information Updates: The Network Customer shall provide the ISO 
with annual updates of Regional Network Load and Network Resource forecasts consistent with those 
included in its Application under Part II.B of this OATT including, but not limited to, any information 
provided under Section 16.2(i) pursuant to Attachment K. The Network Customer also shall provide the 
ISO with timely written notice of material changes in any other information provided in its Application 
relating to the Network Customer’s Regional Network Load, Network Resources, its transmission system 
or other aspects of its facilities or operations affecting the ability of the ISO to provide reliable service.  
 
 
 
II.19 
 Study Procedures For Regional Network Service Requests  
 
II.19.1 Notice of Need for System Impact Study: After receiving a request for service, the ISO shall 
review the effect of the requested service on the reliability requirements to meet existing and pending 
obligations of any affected Transmission Owner(s) and on the obligations of the particular PTO(s) whose 
PTF facilities will be impacted by the proposed service and shall determine on a non-discriminatory basis 
whether a System Impact Study is needed. A description of the methodology for completing a System 
Impact Study is provided in Attachment D to this OATT.  If the ISO determines that a System Impact 
Study is necessary to accommodate the requested service, it shall as soon as practicable so inform the 
Eligible Customer and any affected Transmission Owner(s), and so inform the PTO(s) if the System Impact 
Study is to be performed by the PTO(s).  If the likely result of the study is that a Direct Assignment Facility 
will be required, the study shall be performed by the affected PTO(s), subject to review by the ISO. In such 
cases, the ISO shall within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Completed Application, tender a System Impact 
Study agreement in the form of Attachment I to this OATT, or in any other form that is mutually agreed to, 
pursuant to which the Eligible Customer shall agree to reimburse the ISO and any affected Transmission 
Owner(s) for performing or participating in the required System Impact Study. For a service request to 
remain a Completed Application, the Eligible Customer shall execute a System Impact Study agreement 
and return it to the ISO within fifteen (15) days. If the Eligible Customer elects not to execute a System 
Impact Study agreement, its Application shall be deemed withdrawn and its deposit (less the reasonable 
administrative costs incurred by the ISO and any affected Transmission Owner(s) shall be returned with 
Interest. 
 
II.19.2 System Impact Study Agreement and Cost Reimbursement:  
 
(a) The System Impact Study agreement, whether in the form detailed in Attachment I or in any 
other form that is mutually agreed to, will clearly specify the ISO’s actual estimate of the actual 
cost, and time for completion of the System Impact Study. The actual charge shall not exceed 
the actual cost of the study. The System Impact Study shall rely, to the extent reasonably 
practicable, on existing transmission planning studies. The Eligible Customer will not be 
assessed a charge for such existing studies; however, the Eligible Customer will be responsible 
for charges associated with any modifications to existing planning studies that are reasonably 
necessary to evaluate the impact of the Eligible Customer’s request for service on the PTF.  
 
 
 
(b) If in response to multiple Eligible Customers requesting the service in relation to the same 
competitive solicitation, a single System Impact Study to accommodate the service, the costs of 
that study shall be prorated among the Eligible Customers.  
 
(c)  For System Impact Studies conducted on behalf of a Transmission Owner, the Transmission 
Owners on whose behalf the System Impact Study is conducted will record the cost of the 
System Impact Studies pursuant to Section II.8.5 of this OATT.  
 
II.19.3 System Impact Study Procedures: Upon receipt of an executed System Impact Study agreement, 
the ISO and any affected Transmission Owners and indirectly affected MTOs or OTOs will use due 
diligence to complete the required System Impact Study within a sixty-day period. The System Impact 
Study, if required, shall identify any system constraints, or the need for additional Direct Assignment 
Facilities or other facility additions or upgrades to provide the requested service. In the event that the ISO 
and the PTO designated to perform the study are unable to complete the required System Impact Study 
within such time period, the ISO shall so notify the Eligible Customer and provide an estimated completion 
date along with an explanation of the reasons why additional time is required to complete the required 
studies and an estimate of any increase in cost which will result from the delay. A copy of the completed 
System Impact Study and related work papers shall be made available to the Eligible Customer as soon as 
the System Impact Study is complete. The ISO will use the same due diligence in completing the System 
Impact Study for an Eligible Customer as it uses when completing studies for the Transmission Owners. 
The ISO shall notify the Eligible Customer immediately upon completion of the System Impact Study if the 
New England Transmission System will be adequate to accommodate all or part of a request for service or 
that no costs are likely to be incurred for new transmission facilities or upgrades. In order for a request to 
remain a Completed Application, within fifteen (15) days of completion of the System Impact Study the 
Eligible Customer must execute a Transmission Service Agreement(s) or request the filing of an 
unexecuted Transmission Service Agreement(s), or the Application shall be deemed terminated and 
withdrawn.  
 
II.19.4 Facilities Study Procedures: If a System Impact Study indicates that additions or upgrades to the 
PTF are needed to supply the Eligible Customer’s service or to mitigate indirect impacts on the MTF or 
OTF facilities, the ISO, within thirty (30) days of the completion of the System Impact Study, shall tender 
to the Eligible Customer a Facilities Study agreement in the form of Attachment J to this OATT, or in any 
other form that is mutually agreed to, which is to be entered into by the Eligible Customer and the ISO and, 
if deemed necessary by the ISO, by one or more affected PTO(s) and pursuant to which the Eligible 
 
 
Customer shall agree to reimburse the ISO and any affected PTO(s) for performing the required Facilities 
Study. For a service request to remain a Completed Application, the Eligible Customer shall execute the 
Facilities Study agreement and return it to the ISO within fifteen (15) days. If the Eligible Customer elects 
not to execute a Facilities Study agreement, its Application shall be deemed withdrawn and its deposit, if 
any (less the reasonable Administrative Costs incurred by the ISO and any affected entities), shall be 
returned with Interest. Upon receipt of an executed Facilities Study agreement, the ISO and any affected 
PTO(s), will use due diligence to complete the required Facilities Study within a sixty-day period. If the 
ISO and any affected PTO(s) are unable to complete the Facilities Study in the allotted time period, the ISO 
shall notify the Eligible Customer and provide an estimate of the time needed to reach a final determination 
and any resulting increase in the cost, along with an explanation of the reasons that additional time is 
required to complete the study. When completed, the Facilities Study will include a good faith estimate of 
(i) the cost of Direct Assignment Facilities to be charged to the Eligible Customer, (ii) the Eligible 
Customer’s appropriate share of the cost of any required Transmission Upgrades, and (iii) the time required 
to complete such construction and initiate the requested service. The Eligible Customer shall provide a 
letter of credit or other reasonable form of security acceptable to the affected PTO(s) or other entities that 
will be responsible for the construction of the new facilities or upgrades equivalent to the costs of new 
facilities or upgrades consistent with commercial practices as established by the Uniform Commercial 
Code. The Eligible Customer shall have thirty (30) days to execute a Transmission Service Agreement(s) or 
request the filing of an unexecuted Transmission Service Agreement(s) and provide the required letter of 
credit or other form of security or the request no longer will be a Completed Application and shall be 
deemed terminated and withdrawn. In addition to the foregoing, each Facilities Study shall, if requested by 
the Transmission Customer, contain a non-binding estimate from the ISO of the Incremental ARRs, if any, 
resulting from the construction of the new facilities. After completion of the transmission upgrade or 
expansion, the ISO shall determine the Incremental ARRs, if any, resulting from the upgrade or expansion. 
The Transmission Customer shall be responsible for the cost of any study required to determine the 
Incremental ARRs.  
 
II.19.5 Penalties for Failure to Meet Study Deadlines:  
Sections 19.3 and 19.4 require the ISO to use due diligence to meet 60-day study completion deadlines for 
System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies.  
 
(i)  
The ISO is required to file a notice with the Commission in the event that more than twenty 
(20) percent of System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies completed by the ISO in any 
two consecutive calendar quarters are not completed within the 60-day study completion 
 
 
deadlines. Such notice must be filed within thirty (30) days of the end of the calendar 
quarter triggering the notice requirement.  
 
(ii)  
For the purposes of calculating the percent of System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies 
processed outside of the 60day study completion deadlines, the ISO shall consider all 
System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies that it completes during the calendar quarter. 
The percentage should be calculated by dividing the number of those studies which are 
completed on time by the total number of completed studies. The ISO may provide an 
explanation in its notification filing to the Commission if it believes there are extenuating 
circumstances that prevented it from meeting the 60-day study completion deadlines.  
 
(iii)  
The ISO is subject to an operational penalty if it completes ten (10) percent or more of 
System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies outside of the 60-day study completion 
deadlines for each of the two calendar quarters immediately following the quarter that 
triggered its notification filing to the Commission. The operational penalty will be assessed 
for each calendar quarter for which an operational penalty applies, starting with the 
calendar quarter immediately following the quarter that triggered the ISO’s notification 
filing to the Commission. The operational penalty will continue to be assessed each quarter 
until the ISO completes at least ninety (90) percent of all System Impact Studies and 
Facilities Studies within the 60-day deadline.  
 
For penalties assessed in accordance with subsection (iii) above, the penalty amount for each System 
Impact Study or Facilities Study shall be equal to $500 for each day the ISO takes to complete that study 
beyond the 60-day deadline.  
 
II.19.6 Clustering of Regional Network Service Studies:  
(a) Cluster Studies Request: The ISO, on its own initiative, or at the request of a group of Eligible 
Customers may consider studying specified requests for Regional Network Service in a cluster 
for the purpose of the System Impact Study and Facilities Study.  
 
(b) Notice of Study Cluster: At the same time that the ISO informs the Eligible Customers that a 
System Impact Study or a Facilities Study is necessary to accommodate the requested Regional 
Network Service in accordance with Sections II.19.1 and II.19.4 of this OATT, the ISO will 
also notify the Eligible Customers, either in response to their joint request or on its own 
 
 
initiative that (i) studying specific multiple requests for Regional Network Service in a cluster 
may result in a more efficient study process or may result in a more efficient and economic 
construction of the new facilities or upgrades and (ii) it can reasonably accommodate the 
cluster study, in light of the complexity involved in studying multiple requests for service 
simultaneously and the time necessary to perform a cluster study, as specified in Sections 
II.19.3 and II.19.4 of this OATT. If an Eligible Customer chooses not to have its request for 
Regional Network Service studied as part of the cluster, it shall have ten (10) days from the 
date that the ISO notifies the Eligible Customer of its intent to study specific multiple requests 
for Regional Network Service in a cluster to inform the ISO of its determination to have its 
request studied separately.  
 
(c)  Cluster Study Process and Procedures: The ISO shall follow the process and procedures set 
forth in Sections II.19.1 through II.19.4 of this OATT with respect to the performance of the 
System Impact Study and the Facilities Study, except that:  
 
(i)  For clustered studies, a single study agreement either in the form detailed in Attachment I 
or Attachment J of this OATT, as applicable, or in any other form that is mutually agreed to, 
will be tendered by the ISO to all Eligible Customers, which is to be entered into by all the 
Eligible Customers and the ISO and, if deemed necessary by the ISO, by one or more affected 
PTO(s), and pursuant to which the Eligible Customers shall agree to reimburse the ISO and 
affected PTO(s) for performing the required study. The costs of that study will be divided 
equally among the Eligible Customers, unless otherwise agreed to by the ISO and the Eligible 
Customers.  
 
(ii) For clustered studies, the 60-day time periods for completion of the System Impact Study 
and the Facilities Study will commence on the date on which all Eligible Customers in the 
cluster have executed the applicable study agreement. If the ISO and any affected PTO(s) are 
unable to complete the applicable study in the allotted time period, the ISO shall notify the 
Eligible Customers and provide an estimate of the time needed to complete the study and an 
explanation of the reasons that additional time is required to complete the study.    
 
(iii) In the event that ISO determines that additions or upgrades to the PTF are required to 
accommodate the requests for Regional Network Service that are studied as part of a cluster, 
the costs of the Transmission Upgrades will be allocated to each Eligible Customer whose 
 
 
request was studied as part of the cluster based on each Eligible Customer’s share of the total 
megawatts of service requested, unless otherwise agreed to by the ISO and the Eligible 
Customers.  
 
(iv) At the request of a Transmission Customer whose Regional Network Service request was 
studied as part of a cluster, the ISO shall provide a non-binding estimate of the Incremental 
ARRs, if any, resulting from the construction of new facilities based on the Transmission 
Customer’s share of the costs of the new facilities. The Transmission Customer shall be 
responsible for the cost of any study required to determine the Incremental ARRs.  
 
 
 
II.20  Load Shedding and Curtailments  
 
II.20.1 Procedures: Prior to the Service Commencement Date, the ISO and the Network Customer shall 
establish Load Shedding and Curtailment procedures pursuant to Section II.22 of this OATT with the 
objective of responding to contingencies on the PTF. The parties will implement such programs during any 
period when the ISO determines that a system contingency exists and such procedures are necessary to 
alleviate such contingency. The ISO will notify all affected Network Customers in a timely manner of any 
scheduled Curtailment.  
 
II.20.2 Transmission Constraints: During any period when the ISO determines that a transmission 
constraint exists on the PTF, MTF or OTF, and such constraint may impair the reliability of the New 
England Transmission System, the ISO will take whatever actions, consistent with Good Utility Practice, 
that are reasonably necessary to maintain the reliability of the system. To the extent the ISO determines that 
the reliability of the system can be maintained by redispatching resources, the ISO will initiate procedures 
pursuant to Section II.22 of this OATT to redispatch the appropriate resources and the Transmission 
Customers’ own resources on a least-cost basis without regard to the ownership of such resources. Any 
redispatch under this section may not unduly discriminate between the PTO’s use of the PTF on behalf of 
their Native Load Customers and any Network Customer’s use of the PTF to serve its designated Regional 
Network Load.  
 
II.20.3 Cost Responsibility for Relieving Transmission Constraints: Whenever the ISO implements 
least-cost redispatch procedures in response to a transmission constraint, the Transmission Customers will 
bear the costs of such redispatch in accordance with ISO New England Operating Documents.  
 
II.20.4 Curtailments of Scheduled Deliveries: If a transmission constraint on the PTF, MTF or OTF 
cannot be relieved through the implementation of least-cost redispatch procedures and the ISO determines 
that it is necessary to effect a Curtailment of scheduled deliveries, such schedule shall be curtailed in 
accordance with Section II.22 of this OATT.  
 
II.20.5 Allocation of Curtailments: The ISO shall on a non-discriminatory basis, effect a Curtailment of 
the transaction(s) that effectively relieves the constraint. However, to the extent practicable and consistent 
with Good Utility Practice, any Curtailment will be shared by the customers taking MTF Service, OTF 
Service and/or Through or Out Service and Network Customers on a nondiscriminatory basis. The ISO 
 
 
shall not direct the Network Customer to effect a Curtailment of its schedules to an extent greater than the 
ISO would effect a Curtailment of the Transmission Owner’s or Schedule 20A Service Provider’s 
schedules under similar circumstances. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section, 
Real-Time External Transactions shall be scheduled and curtailed in accordance with Section II.44 of this 
OATT.  
 
II.20.6 Load Shedding: To the extent that a system contingency exists on the PTF, OTF and/or MTF and 
the ISO determines that it is necessary for the customers taking MTF Service, OTF Service and/or Through 
or Out Service and Network Customers to shed load, the Parties shall shed load in accordance with the ISO 
New England Operating Documents.  
 
II.20.7 System Reliability: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this OATT, the ISO reserves the right, 
consistent with Good Utility Practice and on a not unduly discriminatory basis, to effect a Curtailment of 
Regional Network Service without liability on the part of the ISO or the Transmission Owners for the 
purpose of making necessary adjustments to, changes in, or repairs on the Transmission Owners’ lines, 
substations and facilities, and in cases where the continuance of Regional Network Service would endanger 
persons or property. In the event of any adverse condition(s) or disturbance(s) on the PTF or on any other 
system(s) directly or indirectly interconnected with the PTF, the ISO, consistent with Good Utility Practice, 
also may effect a Curtailment of Regional Network Service in order to (i) limit the extent or damage of the 
adverse condition(s) or disturbance(s), (ii) prevent damage to generating or transmission facilities, or (iii) 
expedite restoration of service. The ISO will give the Transmission Customer as much advance notice as is 
practicable in the event of such Curtailment. Any Curtailment of Regional Network Service will be not 
unduly discriminatory relative to the Transmission Owners’ or Schedule 20A Service Provider’s use of the 
Transmission System on behalf of their Native Load Customers. Section II.22 of this OATT shall specify 
the rate treatment and all related terms and conditions applicable in the event that the Transmission 
Customer fails to respond to established Load Shedding and Curtailment procedures. 
 
 
Effective Date: 9/1/2021 - Docket #: ER21-2337-002 
 
II.21  Rates and Charges  
 
II.21.1 Regional Network Service: Each Transmission Customer which has a load in the New England 
Control Area and takes Regional Network Service for a month shall be subject to the applicable 
provisions of Part II.B. of this OATT and shall pay to the ISO for such month an amount equal to its 
Monthly Regional Network Load for the month times the applicable Local Network RNS Rate (except as 
provided for in Section II.21.3), and shall pay in addition any amount which it is required to pay for the 
service pursuant to Section II.18.3 and Schedules 13 and 14 of this OATT. It shall also be obligated to 
pay for any Direct Assignment Facilities and its share of any new facilities or upgrades required to 
provide the requested service including applicable study costs to the extent they are consistent with 
Commission policy and Schedules 11 and 12, and any ancillary service charges and other charges and/or 
costs required to be paid pursuant to the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff. The applicable Local 
Network RNS Rate shall be the rate, determined in accordance with Schedule 9 to this OATT, which is 
applicable to (i) a delivery to load in the particular Local Network in which the load served by the 
Transmission Customer is located, or (ii) to the extent that the ISO, after consultation with the affected 
PTOs, at the request of a PTO who owns the Local Network where the Regional Network Load is located, 
recognizes Regional Network Load to be the responsibility of another PTO, the applicable Local Network 
RNS Rate shall be the Local Network RNS Rate of the PTO responsible for such Regional Network 
Load. In the event the Transmission Customer serves Regional Network Load located on more than one 
Local Network, the amount to be paid by it shall be separately computed for the Regional Network Load 
located on each Local Network.  
 
II.21.2 Determination of Network Customer’s Monthly Regional Network Load: Network 
Customer’s “Monthly Regional Network Load” is its hourly load (including its designated Regional 
Network Load not physically interconnected with the PTF under Section II.18.3 of this OATT) coincident 
with the coincident aggregate load of all Network Customers served in each Local Network in the hour in 
which the coincident load is at its maximum for the month (“Monthly Peak”). Network Customer’s 
Monthly Regional Network Load shall exclude (i) load offset by any resource that is not a Generator 
Asset, and (ii) load offset by the portion of the output of a Generator Asset that serves load located behind 
the same retail customer meter as the Generator Asset. For Regional Network Load located within the 
New England Control Area, the Monthly Regional Network Load of all Network Customers within a 
Local Network shall be calculated by the associated PTO. For Regional Network Load located outside of 
 
 
Effective Date: 9/1/2021 - Docket #: ER21-2337-002 
the New England Control Area, the Monthly Regional Network Load of all Network Customers shall be 
calculated by the associated PTO (in consultation with the ISO and the associated Balancing Authority). 
 
II.21.3 Exception to Payment for Regional Network Service: Regional Network Service charges 
associated with an Electric Storage Facility’s charging load:  The applicable Local Network RNS Rate 
shall be reduced to zero for monthly Regional Network Load associated with the charging load of an 
Electric Storage Facility.  The reduction to zero of the applicable Local Network RNS Rate shall only 
apply to the Schedule 9 charges.  This discount will only be applied to Electric Storage Facility charging 
load that (a) is reported under a separately identified Regional Network Load that does not include station 
service load or any other load and (b) is providing one or more of the following services to the ISO: 
reactive power voltage support, operating reserves, regulation and frequency response, balancing energy 
supply and demand, or addressing a reliability concern.  Electric Storage Facilities shall be considered to 
be balancing energy supply and demand when they are responding to ISO dispatch instructions in the 
Real-Time Energy Market.  The applicable Local Network RNS Rate will be applied to Electric Storage 
Facility charging load unless it is reported as described in (a) above and is providing one or more services 
as described in (b) above.

II.C. 
THROUGH OR OUT SERVICE; LOCAL SERVICE; MTF SERVICE; OTF SERVICE  
Through or Out Service, Local Service, MTF Service or OTF Service will be provided pursuant to the 
applicable terms and conditions of Part II.C, Schedule 18, Schedule 20 and Schedule 21 of this OATT.  
 
When a Real-Time External Transaction that exports energy out of or wheels energy through the New 
England Control Area is submitted by the Transmission Customer and is scheduled in the Real-Time 
Energy Market, the submission shall be deemed a request for Through or Out Service and the ISO shall 
generate a reservation for transmission service over the PTF equal to the transaction’s maximum scheduled 
flow during the operating hour.  This reservation amount shall be the basis for the Reserved Capacity. The 
Transmission Customer shall pay for its Reserved Capacity under the terms of Section II.25, Section II.27, 
Section II.29, and the Local Service Schedule of this OATT, whichever is applicable.  
  
 
 
II.24  Through or Out Service  
 
II.24.1 Provision of Through or Out Service:  Through or Out Service shall be provided by the ISO, and 
shall be available to any Transmission Customer.  
 
II.24.2 Use of Through or Out Service:  A Transmission Customer shall take Through or Out Service for 
the transmission of any transaction that requires the use of PTF if either (i) the transaction goes through the 
New England Control Area and the Point(s) of Receipt are at one point on the New England Control Area 
boundary and the Point(s) of Delivery are at another point on the New England Control Area boundary, as, 
for example, from New Brunswick to New York or from one point on the New England Control Area 
boundary with New York to another point on the Control Area boundary with New York, or (ii) the 
transaction goes out of the New England Control Area and the Point(s) of Receipt are within the New 
England Control Area and the Point(s) of Delivery are at a New England Control Area boundary, as, for 
example, from Boston to New York.  
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2022 - Docket #: ER20-2054-001 
 
II.25 Payment and Rate for Through or Out Service 
II.25.1 Payment for Through or Out Service: Each Transmission Customer that takes Through or Out 
Service shall pay to the ISO a charge per kilowatt of Reserved Capacity based on an annual rate (the 
“TOUT Rate”) which shall be the RNS Rate, except as provided for in Section II.25.3. The Transmission 
Customer shall also be obligated to pay any ancillary service charges and any other charges required to be 
paid pursuant to this Tariff. 
II.25.2 Rate for Through or Out Service (“TOUT Rate”): The rate per hour for Through or Out 
Service shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (2) of Schedule 8. 
II.25.3 Exceptions to Payment for Through or Out Service: Through or Out Service Charges to the 
New York Control Area: The TOUT Rate shall be reduced to zero for any Through or Out Service 
transaction that (a) goes through or out of the New England Control Area and (b) has the New 
England/New York Control Area boundary as its Point of Delivery, provided that a Commission-
approved New York ISO tariff provision is in effect that reduces charges to zero on transactions through 
or out of the New York Control Area to the New England Control Area boundary. The reduction to zero 
of the TOUT Rate to New York shall only apply to the Schedule 8 charges. The reduction of the TOUT 
Rate to zero pursuant to this Section II.25.3 shall not apply to transmission customers taking service 
under Section II.18.3 of this Tariff; such transmission customers shall continue to pay charges for such 
service based on the full TOUT Rate as applied to the amount reserved for the Regional Network Load 
which is not physically interconnected with the PTF. 
 
 
II.26  Reservation of Capacity for Through or Out Service  
Compliance with the applicable requirements of Part II.C of this OATT is required for the initiation of 
Through or Out Service.  
 
 
II.27  MTF Service  
Schedule 18 to this OATT shall govern MTF Service.  
 
 
II.28  Local Service  
Schedule 21 to this OATT shall govern Local Point-to-Point Service and Local Network Service.  
 
 
II.29  OTF Service  
Schedule 20 to this OATT shall govern OTF Service.  
 
 
II.30  Nature of Through or Out Service  
Advance reservations will not be required for Through or Out Service under this OATT.  However, other 
advance reservations may be required for MTF Service and OTF Service pursuant to Schedule 18 and 
Schedule 20 to this OATT, as appropriate.  When a Real-Time External Transaction that exports energy 
out of, or wheels energy through, the New England Control Area is submitted by the Transmission 
Customer and is scheduled in the Real-Time Energy Market, the submission shall be deemed a request for 
Through or Out Service and the ISO shall generate a reservation for Through or Out Service equal to the 
transaction’s maximum scheduled flow during the operating hour; this reservation amount shall be the basis 
for the Reserved Capacity.  The Transmission Customer shall pay for its Reserved Capacity under the 
terms of Section II.25 of this OATT.  
 
II.30.1 Term:  The term of Through or Out Service shall be one hour increments in conjunction with 
Real-Time External Transactions scheduled in the Real-Time Energy Market.  
 
II.30.2 Transmission Priority: All Through or Out Service offered under this OATT will be deemed to 
have the same transmission priority. Through or Out Service will have transmission priority equal to Native 
Load Customers, Network Customers and customers for Excepted Transactions. In the event the PTF, OTF 
and MTF are constrained, transmission priorities shall be established separately for the PTF, OTF and 
MTF, respectively.  
 
II.30.3 Use of Through or Out Service by the Transmission Owners or Schedule 20A Service 
Providers: To the extent that a Transmission Owner or Schedule 20A Service Provider conducts business 
as a Transmission Customer it will be subject to the rates, terms and conditions of this OATT when making 
Third-Party Sales to be transmitted as Through or Out Service under (i) agreements executed after 
November 1, 1996 or (ii) agreements executed on or before November 1, 1996 to the extent that the 
Commission requires them to be unbundled, by the date specified by the Commission. A Transmission 
Owner or Schedule 20A Service Provider will maintain separate accounting, pursuant to Section II.8 of this 
OATT, for any use of Through or Out Service to make Third-Party Sales to the extent not paid for under this 
OATT. To the extent that a Transmission Owner or Schedule 20A Service Provider conducts business as a 
Transmission Customer it shall be subject to charges associated with its Reserved Capacity across MTF and 
OTF under the terms of Schedule 18 and Schedule 20 to this OATT, as required.  
 
II.30.4 Service Agreements: Unless an MPSA has been executed, a standard form Transmission Service 
Agreement (Attachment A to the OATT) will be offered to an Eligible Customer when it submits a 
 
 
Completed Application for Through or Out Service to be transmitted pursuant to this OATT. Executed 
Service Agreements that contain the information required under this OATT will be filed with the 
Commission in compliance with applicable Commission regulations.  
 
II.30.5 Transmission Customer Obligations for Facility Additions or Redispatch Costs: The ISO will 
redispatch all Resources subject to its control, pursuant to Market Rule 1, in order to meet load and to 
accommodate Real-Time External Transactions. Transmission Customers will be charged for the 
Congestion Costs and any other costs associated with such redispatch in accordance with Market Rule 1.  
 
II.30.6 Classification of Through or Out Service: Deliveries will be provided from the Point(s) of 
Receipt to the Point(s) of Delivery. Each Point of Receipt at which transmission capacity is reserved for 
Through or Out Service by the Transmission Customer shall be set forth in the schedule submitted in 
accordance with the ISO System Rules.  When a Real-Time External Transaction that exports energy out 
of or wheels energy through the New England Control Area is submitted by the Transmission Customer and 
is scheduled in the Real-Time Energy Market, the submission shall be deemed a request for Through or Out 
Service and the ISO will generate a reservation for Through or Out Service equal to the Real-Time External 
Transaction’s maximum scheduled flow during the operating hour; this reservation amount shall be the 
basis for the Reserved Capacity.  The Transmission Customer will be billed and shall pay for its Reserved 
Capacity under the terms of Section II.25 of this OATT.  
 
 
 
II.31  Service Availability  
 
II.31.1 General Conditions:  Through or Out Service on the PTF shall be available to any Transmission 
Customer that has met the applicable requirements of Section II.32.  
 
II.31.2 Determination of Available Transfer Capability on MTF, non-PTF, OTF, and PTF: A 
description of the MTO’s, OTO’s and PTO’s specific methodology for assessing available transfer 
capability over the MTF, OTF and non-PTF that are posted on the OASIS (Section II.5 of this OATT) are 
contained in the Schedule-specific Attachment C to Schedules 18, 20 and 21, respectively, of this OATT. A 
description of the ISO’s specific methodology for assessing available transfer capability over the PTF 
interfaces that is posted on the OASIS (Section II.5 of this OATT) is contained in Attachment C to this 
OATT.  
 
II.31.3 Initiating Service in the Absence of an Executed Transmission Service Agreement: If the ISO 
and the Transmission Customer requesting Through or Out Service, who has not executed an MPSA or on 
whose behalf the ISO has not filed an unexecuted MPSA with the Commission, cannot agree on all the 
terms and conditions of the applicable Transmission Service Agreement, the ISO will file with the 
Commission, within thirty (30) days after the date the Transmission Customer provides written notification 
directing the ISO to file, an unexecuted Transmission Service Agreement containing terms and conditions 
deemed appropriate by the ISO (in consultation with the applicable PTO) for such requested transmission 
service. The service will be commenced subject to the Transmission Customer agreeing to (i) pay whatever 
rate the Commission ultimately determines to be just and reasonable, and (ii) comply with the terms and 
conditions of this OATT including providing appropriate security deposits in accordance with the terms of 
Section II.34.3.  
 
II.31.4 Obligation to Provide Transmission Service that Requires Expansion or Modification of the 
New England Transmission System: If a Transmission Customer requests that the PTF be expanded or 
modified, one or more PTOs or other entities will be designated to use due diligence to expand or modify 
the PTF to increase transfer capability, provided that the Transmission Customer agrees to compensate the 
PTO(s) or other entities that will be responsible for the construction of any new facilities or upgrades for the 
costs of such new facilities or upgrades pursuant to the terms of Section II.38. The ISO and the designated 
PTOs or other entities will conform to Good Utility Practice and the planning obligations in Attachment K 
in determining the need for new transmission facilities or upgrades and in coordinating the design and 
 
 
construction of such facilities. This obligation applies only to those facilities that the designated PTO(s) or 
other entities have the right to expand or modify.  
 
II.31.5 Deferral of Service: Any Incremental ARR associated with new transmission facilities or upgrades 
shall be subject to completion of construction of those transmission facilities and upgrades and to such 
upgrades being placed in service.  
 
II.31.6 Real Power Losses: Real power losses are associated with all transmission service. The ISO, 
Transmission Owners and Schedule 20A Service Providers are not obligated to provide real power losses. 
The cost of PTF losses shall be recovered through the Loss Component of the Locational Marginal Prices 
pursuant to Market Rule 1. Real power losses across MTF shall be allocated in accordance with Schedule 
18 of this OATT and real power losses across OTF shall be allocated in accordance with Schedule 20 of this 
OATT.  
 
II.31.7 Load Shedding: To the extent that a system contingency exists on the PTF, MTF or OTF and the 
ISO determines that it is necessary for the Transmission Owners and the Transmission Customers to shed 
load, the Parties shall shed load in accordance with the ISO System Rules or in accordance with other 
mutually agreed-to provisions.  
 
 
 
II.32  Transmission Customer Responsibilities  
 
II.32.1 Conditions Required of Transmission Customers: Through or Out Service will be provided only

Any additional information required by the planning process in Attachment K.  
 
The ISO will treat this information consistent with the standards of conduct contained in 18 C.F.R. Part 37 
of the Commission’s regulations.  
 
II.33.3 Deposit: A Completed Application for Through or Out Service by a Transmission Customer that is 
not a Market Participant shall also include a deposit of one month’s charge based on the estimate of the 
capacity and energy expected to be delivered to the Receiving Party. If the Application is rejected by the 
ISO because it does not meet the conditions for service as set forth herein, or in the case of requests for 
service arising in connection with losing bidders in a request for proposals (“RFP”), the deposit will be 
returned with Interest, less any reasonable administrative costs incurred by the ISO or any affected 
Transmission Owners in connection with the review of the Application. The deposit also will be returned 
with Interest less any reasonable administrative costs incurred by the ISO or any affected Transmission 
Owner if the new facilities or upgrades needed to provide the service cannot be completed. If an 
Application is withdrawn or the Eligible Customer decides not to enter into a Transmission Service 
Agreement for the service, the deposit will be refunded in full, with Interest, less reasonable administrative 
costs incurred by the ISO or any affected Transmission Owners to the extent such costs have not already 
been recovered from the Eligible Customer. The ISO will provide to the Eligible Customer a complete 
accounting of all costs deducted from the refunded deposit, which the Eligible Customer may contest if 
 
 
there is a dispute concerning the deducted costs. Deposits associated with construction of new facilities or 
upgrades are subject to the provisions of Section II.34 of this OATT. If a Transmission Service Agreement 
for Through or Out Service is executed, the deposit, with interest, will be returned to the Transmission 
Customer upon expiration or termination of the Transmission Service Agreement. Applicable Interest will 
be calculated from the day the deposit is credited to the ISO’s account.  
 
II.33.4 Notice of Deficient Application: If an Application fails to meet the requirements of this OATT, the 
ISO will notify the entity requesting service within fifteen (15) days of the ISO’s receipt of the Application 
of the reasons for such failure. The ISO will attempt to remedy minor deficiencies in the Application 
through informal communications with the Eligible Customer. If such efforts are unsuccessful, the ISO will 
return the Application, along with any deposit (less the reasonable administrative costs incurred by the ISO 
or any affected Transmission Owner in connection with the Application), with Interest. Upon receipt of a 
new or revised Application that fully complies with the requirements of this OATT, the Eligible Customer 
will be assigned a new reservation priority based upon the date of receipt by the ISO of the new or revised 
Application.  
 
II.33.5 Execution of Transmission Service Agreement: The ISO will notify the Eligible Customer as 
soon as practicable but no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the Completed Application, and will 
tender a Transmission Service Agreement to the Eligible Customer. The service agreement will allow the 
Transmission Customer that is not a Market Participant to submit External Transactions in accordance with 
Market Rule 1 and the applicable ISO System Rules. Failure of an Eligible Customer to execute and return 
the Transmission Service Agreement or request the filing of an unexecuted Transmission Service 
Agreement pursuant to Section II.31.3, within fifteen (15) days after it is tendered by the ISO shall be 
deemed a withdrawal and termination of the Application and any deposit (less the reasonable administrative 
costs incurred by the ISO and any affected Transmission Owner in connection with the Application) 
submitted will be refunded with Interest. Nothing herein limits the right of an Eligible Customer to file 
another Application after such withdrawal and termination.    
 
 
 
II.34  Study Procedures For Through or Out Service Requests  
 
II.34.1 Notice of Need for System Impact Study: After receiving a request for Through or Out Service (a 
“Study Request”), the ISO will review the effect of the proposed service on the reliability requirements to 
meet existing and pending obligations of the Transmission Customers, and the obligations of any affected 
Transmission Owner(s) whose facilities will be impacted by the proposed service and determine on a 
non-discriminatory basis whether a System Impact Study is needed.  A description of the methodology for 
completing a System Impact Study is provided in Attachment D.  After receiving a Request, the ISO will 
within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Study Request, tender a System Impact Study agreement in the form 
of Attachment I to this OATT, or in any other form that is mutually agreed to, pursuant to which the Eligible 
Customer shall agree to reimburse the ISO and any affected Transmission Owners for performing or 
participating in the required System Impact Study. Before a Study Request is evaluated, the Eligible 
Customer shall execute the System Impact Study agreement and return it to the ISO within fifteen (15) 
days. If the Eligible Customer elects not to execute a System Impact Study agreement, its request shall be 
deemed withdrawn and its deposit (less the reasonable administrative costs incurred by the ISO and any 
affected Transmission Owner(s) in connection with the Application), will be returned with Interest.  
 
II.34.2 System Impact Study Agreement and Cost Reimbursement:  
 
(i)  
The System Impact Study agreement shall clearly specify the ISO’s estimate of the actual 
cost, and time for completion of the System Impact Study. The charge shall not exceed the 
actual cost of the study. The System Impact Study will rely, to the extent reasonably 
practicable, on existing transmission planning studies. The Eligible Customer shall not be 
assessed a charge for such existing studies; however, the Eligible Customer shall be 
responsible for charges associated with any modifications to existing planning studies that 
are reasonably necessary to evaluate the impact of the Eligible Customer’s request for 
service on the PTF and indirectly affected MTF or OTF.  
 
(ii)  
If in response to multiple Eligible Customers requesting a similar study in relation to the 
same competitive solicitation, a single System Impact Study is sufficient to accommodate 
the requests, the costs of that study will be equitably prorated among the Eligible 
Customers.  
 
 
 
(iii)  
For System Impact Studies conducted on behalf of a Transmission Owner, the 
Transmission Owner will record the cost of the System Impact Studies pursuant to Section 
II.8.5 to this OATT.  
 
II.34.3 System Impact Study Procedures: Upon receipt of an executed System Impact Study agreement, 
the ISO and any affected Transmission Owners will use due diligence to complete the required System 
Impact Study within a sixty-day period. The System Impact Study shall identify the need for additional 
Direct Assignment Facilities or facility additions or upgrades required to comply with the Eligible 
Customer’s request. In the event that the required System Impact Study cannot be completed within such 
time period, the ISO will so notify the Eligible Customer and provide an estimated completion date along 
with an explanation of the reasons why additional time is required to complete the required study and an 
estimate of any increase in cost which will result from the delay. A copy of the completed System Impact 
Study and related work papers shall be made available to the Eligible Customer as soon as the System 
Impact Study is complete. The ISO will use the same due diligence in completing the System Impact Study 
for an Eligible Customer that is not a Market Participant as it uses when completing studies for an Eligible 
Customer that is a Market Participant. The ISO will notify the Eligible Customer immediately upon 
completion of the System Impact Study.  
 
II.34.4 Facilities Study Procedures: After a System Impact Study indicates that additions or upgrades to 
the PTF or indirectly affected MTF or OTF are needed to accommodate the Eligible Customer’s Request, 
the ISO, within thirty (30) days of the completion of the System Impact Study, will tender to the Eligible 
Customer a Facilities Study agreement in the form of Attachment J to this OATT, or in any other form that 
is mutually agreed to, which is to be entered into by the Eligible Customer and the ISO and, if deemed 
necessary by the ISO, by one or more PTO(s) and pursuant to which the Eligible Customer shall agree to 
reimburse the ISO and any affected PTO(s) or other entity designated by the ISO for performing any 
required Facilities Study. If the Eligible Customer wants the ISO to undertake the Facilities Study, the 
Eligible Customer shall execute the Facilities Study agreement and return it to the ISO within fifteen (15) 
days. If the Eligible Customer elects not to execute the Facilities Study agreement, its Study Request shall 
be deemed withdrawn and its deposit, if any (less the reasonable administrative costs incurred by the ISO 
and any affected entity in connection with the Application), will be returned with Interest. Upon receipt of 
an executed Facilities Study agreement, the ISO and any affected PTO(s) or other designated entity will use 
due diligence to cause the required Facilities Study to be completed within a sixty-day period. If a Facilities 
Study cannot be completed in the allotted time period, the ISO will notify the Eligible Customer and 
provide an estimate of the time needed to reach a final determination and any resulting increase in the cost, 
 
 
along with an explanation of the reasons that additional time is required to complete the study. When 
completed, the Facilities Study shall include a good faith estimate of (i) the cost of Direct Assignment 
Facilities to be charged to the Eligible Customer, or (ii) the Eligible Customer’s appropriate share of the 
cost of any required upgrades, modifications or additions to the PTF, and (iii) the time required to complete 
such construction. The Eligible Customer shall provide a letter of credit or other reasonable form of security 
acceptable to the affected Transmission Owner(s)or other entities that will be responsible for the 
construction of the new facilities or upgrades equivalent to the costs of the new facilities or upgrades and 
consistent with relevant commercial practices, as established by the Uniform Commercial Code.  
 
In addition to the foregoing, each Facilities Study shall, if requested by the Transmission Customer, contain 
a non-binding estimate from the ISO of the Incremental ARRs, if any, resulting from the construction of the 
new facilities. After completion of the transmission upgrade or expansion, the ISO shall determine the 
Incremental ARRs, if any, resulting from the upgrade or expansion. The Transmission Customer shall be 
responsible for the cost of any study required to determine the Incremental ARRs.  
 
II.34.5 Facilities Study Modifications: Any change in design arising from inability to site or construct 
proposed facilities will require development of a revised good faith estimate. New good faith estimates also 
will be required in the event of new statutory or regulatory requirements that are effective before the 
completion of construction or other circumstances beyond the control of the affected Transmission Owners 
or other entities that are responsible for the construction of the new facilities or upgrades and that 
significantly affect the final cost of the new facilities or upgrades to be charged to the Eligible Customer 
pursuant to the provisions of this OATT.  
 
II.34.6 Due Diligence in Completing New Facilities: The ISO will use due diligence to designate PTOs or 
other entities to add necessary facilities or upgrade the PTF, MTF or OTF within a reasonable time. A PTO 
or other entity will have no obligation to upgrade its existing or planned transmission system if doing so 
would impair system reliability or otherwise impair or degrade existing firm service. Nothing in this OATT 
shall be deemed to create an obligation to build upgrades that an entity does not otherwise have by contract, 
law or regulation.  
 
II.34.7 Expedited Procedures for New Facilities: In lieu of the procedures set forth above, the Eligible 
Customer shall have the option to expedite the process by requesting the ISO to tender at one time, together 
with the results of required studies, an “Expedited Study Request” pursuant to which the Eligible Customer 
would agree to pay for all costs incurred pursuant to the terms of this OATT. In order to exercise this option, 
 
 
the Eligible Customer shall request in writing an Expedited Study Request covering all of the 
above-specified items within thirty (30) days of receiving the results of the System Impact Study 
identifying the need for facility additions or upgrades and costs to be incurred in providing the requested 
service. While the ISO, on behalf of the PTO(s) or other entities that will be responsible for constructing the 
new facilities or upgrades, agrees to provide the Eligible Customer with its best estimate of the new facility 
costs and other charges that may be incurred, such estimate shall not be binding and the Eligible Customer 
shall agree in writing to pay for all costs incurred pursuant to the provisions of this OATT. The Eligible 
Customer shall execute and return such an Expedited Study Request within fifteen (15) days of its receipt or 
the Eligible Customer’s request for service will cease to be a Completed Application and will be deemed 
terminated and withdrawn.  
 
II.34.8 Penalties for Failure to Meet Study Deadlines: Sections 34.3 and 34.4 require the ISO to use due 
diligence to meet 60-day study completion deadlines for System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies.  
(i)  
The ISO is required to file a notice with the Commission in the event that more than twenty 
(20) percent of System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies completed by the ISO in any 
two consecutive calendar quarters are not completed within the 60-day study completion 
deadlines. Such notice must be filed within thirty (30) days of the end of the calendar 
quarter triggering the notice requirement.  
 
(ii)  
For the purposes of calculating the percent of System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies 
processed outside of the 60-day study completion deadlines, the ISO shall consider all 
System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies that it completes during the calendar quarter. 
The percentage should be calculated by dividing the number of those studies which are 
completed on time by the total number of completed studies. The ISO may provide an 
explanation in its notification filing to the Commission if it believes there are extenuating 
circumstances that prevented it from meeting the 60-day study completion deadlines.  
 
(iii)  
The ISO is subject to an operational penalty if it completes ten (10) percent or more of 
System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies outside of the 60-day study completion 
deadlines for each of the two calendar quarters immediately following the quarter that 
triggered its notification filing to the Commission. The operational penalty will be assessed 
for each calendar quarter for which an operational penalty applies, starting with the 
calendar quarter immediately following the quarter that triggered the ISO’s notification 
filing to the Commission. The operational penalty will continue to be assessed each quarter 
 
 
until the ISO completes at least ninety (90) percent of all System Impact Studies and 
Facilities Studies within the 60-day deadline.  
 
(iv)  
For penalties assessed in accordance with subsection (iii) above, the penalty amount for 
each System Impact Study or Facilities Study shall be equal to $500 for each day the ISO 
takes to complete that study beyond the 60-day deadline.  
 
 
 
II.35  New Transmission Facilities for Through or Out Service  
 
II.35.1 Delays in Construction of New Facilities:  If any event occurs that will materially affect the time 
for completion of new facilities, or the ability to complete such facilities, the ISO will promptly notify the 
Transmission Customer.  In such circumstances, the ISO will within thirty (30) days of notifying the 
Transmission Customer of such delays, convene a technical meeting with the Transmission Customer and 
any affected Transmission Owners or other entities responsible for construction to evaluate the alternatives 
available to the Transmission Customer.  The ISO and the affected Transmission Owners or other entities 
will make available to the Transmission Customer studies and work papers related to the delay, including 
all information that is in the possession of the ISO or the Transmission Owners or other entities that are 
responsible for the construction of the new facilities or upgrades that is reasonably needed by the 
Transmission Customer to evaluate any alternatives.  
 
II.35.2 Alternatives to the Original Facility Additions:  When the review process of Section II.35.1 to 
this OATT determines that one or more alternatives exist to the originally planned construction project, the 
ISO will present such alternatives for consideration by the Transmission Customer. If, upon review of any 
alternatives, the Transmission Customer desires to proceed subject to construction of the alternative 
facilities, it may request the ISO to submit a revised Transmission Service Agreement. In the event the ISO 
and the affected PTO(s) or other entities responsible for construction conclude that no reasonable 
alternative exists and the Transmission Customer disagrees, the Transmission Customer may seek relief 
under the dispute resolution procedures pursuant to the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff or it may 
refer the dispute to the Commission for resolution.  
 
II.35.3 Refund Obligation for Unfinished Facility Additions: If the ISO, the affected PTOs or other 
entities responsible for construction and the Transmission Customer mutually agree that no other 
reasonable alternatives exist, the obligation to provide the requested construction of additional facilities 
shall terminate and any deposit made by the Transmission Customer shall be returned, with Interest. The 
Transmission Customer shall be responsible for all costs prudently incurred by the ISO and by the affected 
PTO(s) or other entities that have been responsible for the construction of the new facilities or upgrades 
through the date that any required regulatory approval is denied or construction is suspended and for cost of 
removal, if necessary, of facilities constructed prior to suspension.  
 
 
 
II.36  Provisions Relating to the Systems of Other Utilities  
 
II.36.1 Responsibility for Third-Party System Additions: Neither the ISO nor any other entity which is 
not the Transmission Customer will be responsible for making arrangements for any necessary engineering, 
permitting, and construction of transmission or distribution facilities on the system(s) of any other entity or 
for obtaining any regulatory approval for such facilities. The ISO will undertake reasonable efforts to assist 
the Transmission Customer in obtaining such arrangements, including without limitation, providing any 
information or data required by such other electric system pursuant to Good Utility Practice.  
 
II.36.2 Coordination of Third-Party System Additions: In circumstances where the need for 
transmission facilities or upgrades is identified pursuant to the provisions of this OATT, and if such 
upgrades further require the addition of transmission facilities on third-party systems, the ISO and the 
Transmission Owners or other entities that are responsible for the construction of any new facilities or 
upgrades on the PTF, MTF or OTF will have the right to coordinate construction on the PTF, MTF or OTF 
with the construction required by the third parties. The ISO and the Transmission Owners or other entities 
that are responsible for the construction of any new facilities or upgrades on the PTF, MTF or OTF may, 
after consultation with the Transmission Customer and representatives of such other systems, defer 
construction of new transmission facilities or upgrades on the PTF, MTF or OTF if the new transmission 
facilities on another system cannot be completed in a timely manner. The ISO will notify the Transmission 
Customer in writing of the basis for any decision to defer construction and the specific problems that must 
be resolved before the construction of new facilities will be initiated or resumed. Within sixty (60) days of 
receiving written notification by the ISO of a decision to defer construction pursuant to this section, the 
Transmission Customer may challenge the decision in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures 
contained in the OATT or it may refer the dispute to the Commission for resolution.  
 
 
 
II.37  Metering and Power Factor at Points of Receipt and Delivery 
 
II.37.1 Transmission Customer Obligations:  Unless the ISO otherwise agrees, the Transmission 
Customer shall be responsible for installing and maintaining compatible metering and communications 
equipment to accurately account for the capacity and energy being transmitted under this OATT and to 
communicate the information to the ISO.  Unless otherwise agreed, such equipment shall remain the 
property of the Transmission Owner or Transmission Customer, as applicable.  
 
II.37.2 ISO Access to Metering Data:  The ISO will have access to such metering data as may reasonably 
be required to facilitate measurements and billing under the applicable Service Agreement and ISO New 
England Operating Documents.  
 
II.37.3 Power Factor:  Unless otherwise agreed, the Transmission Customer is required to maintain a 
power factor within the same range as other Transmission Customers and Transmission Owners maintain 
pursuant to Good Utility Practice and applicable ISO requirements.  The power factor requirements are 
specified in the applicable Service Agreement and the ISO Operating Document, where applicable.  
 
 
 
II.38  Compensation for New Facilities and Redispatch Costs  
Whenever a System Impact Study performed in connection with a Study Request identifies the need for 
new facilities or upgrades, the Transmission Customer shall be responsible for such costs to the extent they 
are consistent with Commission policy and Schedules 11, 12 and 21 to this OATT, as applicable. The ISO 
will redispatch all Resources subject to its control, pursuant to Market Rule 1, in order to meet load and to 
accommodate Real-Time External Transactions. Transmission Customers will be charged for the 
Congestion Costs and any other costs associated with such redispatch in accordance with ISO New England 
Operating Documents. The Transmission Customer shall be responsible for costs of new facilities or 
upgrades required to provide the requested service to the extent they are consistent with Commission policy 
and Schedules 11, 12 and 21 to this OATT, as applicable.  
 
 
II.D.  TRANSITION PERIOD SERVICE; EXCEPTED TRANSACTIONS  
The Transition Period, and additional arrangements to be in effect during the succeeding five-year period, 
will permit the phase-in on a negotiated basis of the OATT rates. 
 
 
 
II.39  Transition Arrangements:  
The transition arrangements include (i) the treatment provided for certain Excepted Transactions in Section 
II.40 of this OATT, (ii) the provisions in Schedule 9 to this OATT for the phase-in of the rates for Regional 
Network Service, and (iii) the Transition Period and succeeding five-year period.  
 
 
 
II.40  Excepted Transactions:  
Notwithstanding any other section of the OATT, the power transfers and other uses of the PTF effected 
under the transmission agreements in effect on November 1, 1996 specified below (“Excepted 
Transactions”) will continue to be effected under such agreements for the respective periods specified 
below rather than under this OATT, but not thereafter, and such transfers and other uses will continue to be 
effected after such period, if still occurring, under this OATT.  Transmission Customers receiving service 
under the agreements listed in Attachment G-1 to this OATT shall not be required to take Local Network 
Service for such transfers and other uses. The period for which each Excepted Transaction will continue to 
be effected under such existing transmission agreements shall be, for the period from the effective date of 
the OATT until the termination of the transmission agreement:  
 
(a) 
transfers and other uses within the New England Control Area, as of November 1, 1996, of 
the PTF under the support or exchange agreements specified in Attachment G to this 
OATT;  
 
(b) 
transfers and other uses within the New England Control Area, as of November 1, 1996, of 
the PTF under the comprehensive network service agreements specified in Attachment G-1 
to this OATT; and  
 
(c)  
transfers and other uses within the New England Control Area, as of November 1, 1996, of 
the PTF under the other transmission agreements or OATT service agreements specified in 
Attachment G to this OATT.  
 
The transfers or other uses under any of the transmission agreements covering the transfers referred to 
above shall be in accordance with the terms of the transmission agreement as in effect on November 1, 
1996, or a modification of the terms which is expressly provided for in the agreement as in effect on 
November 1, 1996 and is accomplished without amendment of the agreement or by an amendment entered 
into after November 1, 1996 that does not extend the term of the agreement or increase the amount of the 
service. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing restriction on the amendment after November 1, 1996 of 
transmission agreements with respect to Excepted Transactions, the transmission arrangements for the 
MASSPOWER and Altresco facilities may continue as Excepted Transactions in accordance with 
transmission agreement amendments or memoranda of understanding entered into as of December, 1996 
which do not extend the term of the agreements. The PTOs shall review and approve the addition of 
 
 
agreements (if inadvertently omitted), modifications to existing descriptions of agreements (if incorrectly 
stated), or the deletion of agreements to Attachments G, G-1, G-2, and G-3 to this OATT, provided that the 
PTOs shall file such additions, modifications and deletions to Attachment G, G-1, G-2 and G-3 with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA.  
 
For the purpose of determining transmission priorities under this OATT,  
 
(i)  
internal Excepted Transactions shall have the same transmission priority as Firm 
Point-To-Point Service transactions for resources in existence on the effective date of this 
OATT which are effected as Regional Network Service; and  
 
(ii)  
Excepted Transactions which are External Transactions listed in Attachment G-3 to this 
OATT shall have transmission priority in accordance with Section II.44 of this OATT.  
 
When the transfers and other uses effected under the transmission agreements that are Excepted 
Transactions cease to be Excepted Transactions before the end of their term, the transactions shall be 
effected under this OATT, to the extent appropriate, but the transactions shall continue to have a 
transmission priority not less than the priority that they would have had if Regional Network Service had 
been used for the transactions from the effective date of this OATT. New transactions entered into after 
November 1, 1996 under umbrella OATT agreements then in effect will not be Excepted Transactions.  
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other section of the OATT, existing agreements which provide for the 
support of the costs of transmission facilities or for the interconnection of transmission facilities shall 
continue in effect until the termination of the agreement to provide for such support or for the rights and 
obligations of the parties with respect to the interconnection arrangements.  Attachment G-2 to this OATT 
lists certain additional agreements covering transactions, the status of which is described in the Attachment.  
 
Section II.44 of this OATT shall apply for the purposes of scheduling and curtailment of Excepted 
Transactions that are also External Transactions.  
 
 
II.E.  CONGESTION MANAGEMENT ON THE NE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM  
 
 
 
II.41  Congestion Costs and Congestion Revenue  
When Congestion exists, the Congestion Costs shall be reflected in Locational Marginal Prices calculated 
in accordance with Market Rule 1.  Congestion Cost shall be recovered from Transmission Customers 
taking service under the OATT pursuant to Market Rule 1.  Transmission Congestion Revenue shall be 
collected and disbursed in accordance with Market Rule 1.  
 
 
 
II.42  Financial Transmission Rights  
A system of Financial Transmission Rights shall be implemented pursuant to Sections 5 and 7 of Market 
Rule 1.  
 
 
 
II.43  Auction Revenue Rights and Incremental ARRs:   
A system of Auction Revenue Rights and Incremental ARRs shall be implemented pursuant to Appendix C 
of Market Rule 1.  
 
 
II.F.  EXTERNAL TRANSACTIONS  
 
Effective Date: 9/20/2017 - Docket # ER17-2118-000 
 
II.44  Scheduling and Curtailment Rules  
For purposes of scheduling and Curtailment of Real-Time External Transactions over interconnections 
between the New England Control Area and neighboring Control Areas, the following rules shall apply:  
(1) For External Interfaces that are not subject to Coordinated Transaction Scheduling 
(a)  
Real-Time External Transaction sales and purchases that (i) are supported by those service 
agreements referenced in Attachment G-3 to this OATT that have not opted for Auction 
Revenue Rights consideration under applicable ISO System Rules or (ii) are supported by 
those service agreements referenced in Attachment H to this OATT, and (iii) have been 
submitted into the Real-Time Energy Market prior to the Day-Ahead Energy Market 
Scheduling deadline established in Section III.1.10.1A of the Tariff as a Self-Scheduled 
Real-Time External Transaction (“real-time without price”) at an External Node 
referenced in Attachment G-3 or Attachment H to this OATT shall be assigned the highest 
transmission priority when compared to other Real-Time External Transaction purchases 
or sales at that node having the same offer price or bid price. In the event that the transfer 
limit for a given external interface does not allow all Excepted Transactions or MEPCO 
Grandfathered Transactions submitted over that interface to flow, they shall be scheduled 
or curtailed on a pro-rata basis. For Real-Time External Transactions referenced in 
Attachment G-3 or Attachment H to this OATT that also require an advance physical 
reservation associated with a MTF or OTF external interface, the MTF or OTF 
transmission priority shall take precedence over the above language for the purposes of 
scheduling and curtailment under Sections II.44(1)(c) and II.44(1)(d) of this OATT, 
respectively.  For Excepted Transactions or MEPCO Grandfathered Transactions that are 
tied within economic merit, and tied within transmission priority, such transactions cleared 
in the Day-Ahead Energy Market that have a corresponding Real-Time Energy Market 
External Transaction will have scheduling and curtailment priority in the Real-Time 
Energy Market before Excepted Transactions or MEPCO Grandfathered Transactions not 
cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy Market;  
 
(b)  
For external interfaces where advance physical reservations are not required, in the event 
that the transfer limit for a given external interface does not allow all such Real-Time 
External Transactions submitted over that interface to flow, the scheduling and 
Curtailment of Real-Time External Transactions shall be based on economic merit order in 
accordance with the ISO System Rules.  In the case of a tie within economic merit, 
Effective Date: 9/20/2017 - Docket # ER17-2118-000 
 
transmission priority will be used as the next tiebreaker.  In the case of a tie within 
economic merit and within transmission priority, those External Transactions that cleared 
in the Day-Ahead Energy Market that have a corresponding Real-Time Energy Market 
External Transaction will have scheduling and curtailment priority in the Real-Time 
Energy Market before those that did not clear in the Day-Ahead Energy Market. In the case 
of a tie within economic merit, transmission priority, and Day-Ahead Energy Market 
status, Real-Time External Transactions sales that were submitted pursuant to Section 
III.1.10.7(f) of the Tariff will have scheduling and curtailment priority over those that were 
not submitted pursuant to Section III.1.10.7(f).  After economic merit, transmission 
priority, Day-Ahead Energy Market status, and supported in Real-Time status pursuant to 
Section III.1.10.7(f) of the Tariff have been considered, (i) the Real-Time Energy Market 
timestamp shall be used as the final tiebreaker for External Transactions not submitted 
pursuant to Section II.44(a) and (ii) pro-rata scheduling and curtailment shall be used as the 
final tiebreaker for External Transactions submitted pursuant to Section II.44(a). With the 
exception of Section II.44(a) of this OATT, all transactions crossing external interfaces not 
requiring advance physical reservations shall have equal transmission priority;  
 
(c) 
For external interfaces where advance physical reservations are required, in the event that 
the transfer limit for a given external interface does not allow all such Real-Time External 
Transactions submitted over that interface to flow, the scheduling of Real-Time External 
Transactions which satisfy the reservation requirements for service shall be based on 
economic merit order in accordance with the ISO System Rules.  In the case of a tie within 
economic merit, transmission priority shall be used as a tiebreaker.  Relative to a given 
interface, transmission priority is based on the priority rights of the associated MTF or OTF 
advance physical reservation.  In the case of a tie within economic merit and within a 
category of transmission service, those External Transactions that cleared in the 
Day-Ahead Energy Market that have a corresponding Real-Time Energy Market External 
Transaction shall be scheduled in the Real-Time Energy Market before those that did not 
clear in the Day-Ahead Energy Market. In the case of a tie within economic merit, 
transmission priority, and Day-Ahead Energy Market status, Real-Time External 
Transactions sales that were submitted pursuant to Section III.1.10.7(f) of the Tariff will 
have scheduling and curtailment priority over those that were not submitted pursuant to 
Section III.1.10.7(f). After economic merit, transmission priority, Day-Ahead Energy 
Effective Date: 9/20/2017 - Docket # ER17-2118-000 
 
Market status, and supported in Real-Time status pursuant to Section III.1.10.7(f) of the 
Tariff have been considered, (i) the associated Real-Time Energy Market timestamp shall 
be used as the final tiebreaker for scheduling within a given subcategory of non-firm 
transmission service and (ii) pro-rata scheduling shall be used as the final tiebreaker for ties 
within firm transmission service;  
 
(d) 
For external interfaces where advance physical reservations are required, Curtailments 
resulting from a reduction in total transfer capability shall be based on transmission priority 
of the associated MTF or OTF advance physical reservation to the extent possible.  In the 
case of a tie within a category of transmission service, those External Transactions that 
cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy Market that have a corresponding Real-Time Energy 
Market External Transaction shall be curtailed in the Real-Time Energy Market after those 
that did not clear in the Day-Ahead Energy Market. In the case of a tie within transmission 
priority associated with External Transaction sales that cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy 
Market that have a corresponding Real-Time Energy Market External Transaction, those 
Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that were submitted pursuant to Section 
III.1.10.7(f) of the Tariff will be curtailed after those that were not submitted pursuant to 
Section III.1.10.7(f).  After transmission priority, Day-Ahead Energy Market status, and 
supported in Real-Time status pursuant to Section III.1.10.7(f) of  the Tariff have been 
considered, (i) the associated Real-Time Energy Market timestamp shall be used as the 
final tiebreaker for curtailments within a given sub-category of non-firm transmission 
service and (ii) pro-rata curtailment shall be used as the final tiebreaker for ties within firm 
transmission service;  
 
(e)  In instances of a Real-Time External Transaction scheduled against multiple advance 
physical reservations on a MTF or OTF external interface, the lowest transmission 
priority of the associated advance physical reservations shall apply; and  
(f) Scheduling and Curtailment of Real-Time External Transactions shall be conducted in accordance 
with the specifications of the ISO New England Operating Documents. Real-Time External 
Transactions not satisfying Section III.1.10.7(i) criteria shall be scheduled and curtailed under the 
following protocol as may be necessary to respond to and prevent system-wide Emergencies: (1) 
initial scheduling and curtailment priority shall be based upon whether the transaction cleared the 
Day-Ahead Energy Market; in the case of a tie within Day-Ahead Energy Market cleared 
Effective Date: 9/20/2017 - Docket # ER17-2118-000 
 
transactions, priority will next be given to transactions based on the priority of the transmission 
service; and a tie within any specific transmission service shall be resolved based on the 
timestamp of the Real-Time Energy Market submission; and (2) secondary scheduling and 
curtailment priority shall be provided to External Transactions that were only submitted or 
scheduled in the Real-Time Energy Market and did not clear the Day-Ahead Energy Market; in 
the case of an economic tie among Real-Time Energy Market cleared transactions, priority will 
next be given to transactions based on the priority of the transmission service; and a tie within any 
specific transmission service shall be resolved based on the timestamp of the Real-Time Energy 
Market submission. Real-Time External Transactions satisfying Section III.1.10.7(i) criteria shall 
be treated in accordance with that section. 
(2) For External Interfaces that are subject to Coordinated Transaction Scheduling, the transmission 
priority for all Real Time External Transactions is equal.  As such, the associated Real Time External 
Transactions shall be scheduled and curtailed on the basis of economic merit order in accordance with 
Section III.1.10.7A of the Tariff and the Coordination Agreement between ISO-NE and the NYISO. 
In the event of a tie within economics, all affected Real-Time External Transactions will be reduced on 
a pro-rata basis. 
(3) 
Terms and Conditions applied to all External Interfaces  
 
(a)  
The transmission priority for wheel-through transactions will be based on the transmission 
service utilized at the restricted external interface as indicated by the transmission 
reservation;  
 
(b)  
Transmission Customers wishing to schedule Real-Time External Transactions shall 
comply with applicable ISO System Rules;  
 
 
(c)  
Real-Time External Transactions scheduled in the Real-Time Energy Market shall 
continue to be scheduled and curtailed according to Section II.44(1) and (2), as applicable, 
when there are transmission limitations on an external interface, except as may be 
necessary to respond to emergencies;  
 
(d)  
The ISO will redispatch all Resources subject to its control, pursuant to Market Rule 1, in 
order to meet load and to accommodate Real-Time External Transactions.  Transmission 
Effective Date: 9/20/2017 - Docket # ER17-2118-000 
 
Customers will be charged for the Congestion Cost and any other costs associated with 
such redispatch in accordance with Market Rule 1. Pursuant to such redispatch, in the event 
the ISO exercises its right to effect a Curtailment, in whole or part, of Through or Out 
Service, MTF Service or OTF Service, no credit or other adjustment shall be provided as a 
result of the Curtailment with respect to the charge payable by the customer;  
 
(e)  
The ISO will furnish to the Delivering Party’s system operator schedules from each 
applicable scheduling interval equal to those furnished by the Receiving Party (unless 
reduced for losses) and will deliver the capacity and energy provided by such schedules;  
 
(f)  
Should the Transmission Customer, Delivering Party or Receiving Party revise or terminate 
any schedule, such party shall immediately notify the ISO, and the ISO will have the right to 
adjust accordingly the schedule for capacity and energy to be received and to be delivered;  
 
(g)  
 The ISO shall apply the above-listed rules consistent with maintaining the reliability of the 
New England Transmission System; and  
 
(h) 
The ISO shall develop and post procedures on its Internet website reflecting the above-listed 
External Transaction rules. 
 
 
 
II.45  Grandfathered Agreements  
 
II.45.1 
MEPCO Grandfathered Transmission Service Agreements (MGTSAs) over the New 
Brunswick/New England Interface:  The period for which each MGTSA listed in Attachment H to this 
OATT will be in effect shall be from the effective date on which the costs of the MEPCO transmission 
facilities are included in the Pool RNS Rate under the OATT until the associated transmission agreement 
termination date noted in Attachment H to this OATT, subject to roll over or renewal in accordance with the 
provisions of subsection II.45.1(b) below.  New MEPCO transmission service agreements entered into 
after June 1, 2007 will not be eligible for MGTSA treatment.  
 
The transfers or other uses under any of the MGTSAs and the associated charges shall be in accordance 
with the terms of the pertinent transmission agreement listed in Attachment H or otherwise posted on 
OASIS.  This OATT, including in particular this Section II.45 providing for MGTSA service, will 
supersede and replace Schedule 20B that preexisted this Section II.45, and be deemed its successor. 
MGTSAs may be assigned, rolled over or terminated in accordance with the following terms.  
 
(a)  
Sale or assignment of MGTSAs: An MGTSA holder may sell, assign or transfer all or a 
portion of its rights under the MGTSA, but only to another Eligible Customer 
(“Assignee”). The MGTSA holder that sells, assigns or transfers its rights under its 
MGTSA is hereafter referred to as the Reseller. Compensation to Resellers shall be at rates 
established by agreement between the Reseller and the Assignee.  
 
The Assignee must execute the pro forma service agreement in Attachment H-1 to this 
OATT governing reassignments of transmission service prior to the date on which the 
reassigned service commences. MEPCO shall charge the Reseller, as appropriate, at the 
rate stated in the MGTSA or the associated OASIS schedule and credit the Reseller with 
the price reflected in the Assignee’s Service Agreement with MEPCO or the appropriate 
OASIS schedule; provided that, such credit shall be reversed in the event of non-payment 
by Assignee. The Assignee will receive the same service as did the Reseller and the priority 
for the Assignee will be the same as that of the Reseller. The Assignee will be subject to all 
terms and conditions of this OATT. The Reseller shall remain liable for the performance of 
all obligations under the MGTSA. All sales or assignments of capacity must be conducted 
 
 
through or otherwise posted on OASIS on or before the date the reassigned service 
commences. Resellers may also use the OASIS to post transmission capacity available for 
resale.  
 
(b)  
Reservation Priority for MGTSA holders: MGTSA holders with a contract term of five 
years or more have the right to continue to take transmission service when the MGTSA 
expires or rolls over. The MGTSA holder must provide notice to MEPCO whether it will 
exercise its right of first refusal no less than one year prior to the expiration date of its 
MGTSA. This transmission reservation priority for MGTSA holders is an ongoing right 
that may be exercised at the end of all firm contract terms of five years or longer. MGTSAs 
will become subject to the five year/one year requirement on the first rollover date after 
December 1, 2008; provided that, the one-year notice requirement shall apply to MGTSAs 
with five years or more left in their terms as of December 1, 2008.  
 
(c)  
Terminations: MGTSAs shall be terminated on the associated Attachment H termination 
date, subject to Section II.45(b) above, or, subject to Section 3.11(g) of the TOA, on such 
date mutually agreed upon by the parties.  
 
MEPCO shall periodically review Attachment H and shall file any necessary changes with the 
Commission.  
 
For purposes of determining transmission priorities under this OATT, MGTSAs (which are listed 
in Attachment H) shall have transmission priority in accordance with Section II.44.  
 
Section II.44 of this OATT shall apply for the purposes of scheduling and curtailment of External 
Transactions, including those associated with MGTSAs.  
 
Upon termination or expiration of its MGTSA, the MGTSA holder will receive transmission 
service pursuant to either Schedule 8 or 9 under this OATT, as appropriate.

scheduled generation and transmission facility outages so as to minimize, to the extent 
practicable, Congestion Costs and Local Second Contingency Protection Resource NCPC 
Charges (as calculated pursuant to Market Rule 1) in accordance with the TOA, MTOA and 
applicable ISO New England Operating Procedures.  The ISO shall provide Transmission 
Owners and the operators of the affected Local Control Centers with such information as is 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
necessary to enable them to perform this function.  Any information provided to 
Transmission Owners and the operators of the affected Local Control Centers pursuant to this 
provision will be subject to all the applicable requirements of the Commission’s Order 889.  
 
These provisions for PTF additions and modifications are not intended to be exclusive.  
Nothing in this OATT is intended to preclude any entity from identifying and constructing Elective 
Transmission Upgrades on a merchant or other basis, so long as it obtains all required legal rights and 
approvals and satisfies applicable ISO and affected Transmission Owner requirements relating to such 
facilities.  
 
An addition or modification under the TOA which constitutes PTF under the OATT shall become part of 
the PTF and shall be fully subject to this OATT, whether or not all or any part of the costs of the addition 
or modification are included in Pool Supported PTF costs. The transmission priorities, if any, with respect 
to the use of the addition or modification as among the owner and supporters of the addition or 
modification and other Transmission Customers shall be determined under Parts II.A to II.D, inclusive, of 
this OATT.  
 
To the extent that a Generator Owner is responsible for the costs of a Generator Interconnection Related 
Upgrade or Elective Transmission Upgrade, or an entity other than a Generator Owner is responsible for 
costs of any other system upgrade, the Generator Owner or entity which supports part or all of the costs of 
the addition or modification shall be entitled to a share of any associated Incremental ARRs equivalent to 
the share of the total costs of such upgrade which it supports, as assigned and allocated in accordance 
with Appendix C of Market Rule 1. Any incremental FTRs resulting from Generator Interconnection 
Related Upgrades or other upgrades shall be auctioned along with other FTRs in accordance with Section 
7 of Market Rule 1.  
 
If issues of cost allocation arise with respect to the recovery of any of the costs provided for in this Part 
II.G of this OATT, or in Schedules 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 14A to this OATT, such issues shall be subject to 
determination by the Commission in the appropriate proceeding.  
 
 
 
 
II.G.  SYSTEM PLANNING, ADDITIONS AND MODIFICATIONS 
II.47 
 Interconnection Procedures and Requirements
II.47.1 Interconnection of Generating Unit Under the Capacity Capability Interconnection Standard
or the Network Capability Interconnection Standard:  Any Generator Owner that proposes after the 
Compliance Effective Date (i) to place in service in the New England Control Area a new generating unit at 
a site which the Generator Owner owns or controls, or which it has the right to acquire or control, or (ii) to 
materially change and/or increase the capacity of an existing generating unit located in the New England 
Control Area shall comply with and be subject to the ISO New England Operating Documents, including, 
but not limited to, the Interconnection Procedures contained in Schedules 22 and 23 of this OATT and shall 
enter into an Interconnection Agreement in the form provided in Appendix 6 to Schedule 22 or Exhibit 1 to 
Schedule 23 of this OATT.  The ISO shall have authority to administer the Interconnection Procedures and 
shall be a party to the Interconnection Agreement along with the Interconnection Customer and the 
Interconnecting Transmission Owner (as such terms are defined in Schedules 22 and 23 of this OATT).  
II.47.2 Generator Interconnection Proposal Review: The Generator Owner shall submit its proposal for
review in accordance with Section I.3.9 of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff and related ISO 
New England Operating Documents and thereafter take any action required pursuant to Section I.3.10 of 
the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff as a result of such review.  
II.47.3 Generator Right to Interconnection: Upon the satisfaction of the obligations described in
Sections II.47.1 and II.47.2, and subject to all necessary legal rights and approvals being obtained, the 
Generator Owner’s unit shall have the right to be interconnected with the PTF or Non-PTF.  
II.47.4 Compliance with Schedule 11: A Generator Owner proposing the interconnection of a new or
materially changed generating unit shall be responsible for the costs of any required Generator 
Interconnection Related Upgrades that do not constitute costs of Pool Supported PTF in accordance with 
Schedule 11 of this OATT, and shall comply with the affected PTO’s requirements with respect to security, 
credit assurances and/or deposits in accordance with Schedule 11 of this OATT.  
With respect to upgrades required to meet the Capacity Capability Interconnection Standard or the Network 
Capability Interconnection Standard, and consistent with reliability and safety standards, PTOs (in 
accordance with the TOA and applicable ISO New England Operating Documents), MTOs (in accordance 
with a MTOA and applicable ISO New England Operating Documents), OTOs (in accordance with an 
 
 
OTOA and applicable ISO New England Operation Documents), the interconnecting Generator Owner and 
the ISO shall jointly use their best reasonable efforts to develop Congestion Cost and Local Second 
Contingency Protection Resource NCPC Charge estimates and construction schedules designed to 
minimize, to the extent practicable, the financial impact of the upgrade-related transmission outages on all 
affected parties.  The development of the aforementioned construction schedule shall include consultation 
with any affected existing Generator Owner.  To the extent it is possible to implement a procedure that 
facilitates the ability of interconnecting Generator Owners and Interconnecting Transmission Owners and 
any affected PTO(s) to minimize, to the extent reasonably practicable, the associated Local Second 
Contingency Protection Resource NCPC Charge and Congestion Cost exposure prior to implementation of 
SMD, the parties agree to continue the use of the procedure after the implementation of SMD to the extent 
that such procedures are consistent with SMD.  There shall be no payment under this OATT of lost 
opportunity costs to Generator Owners for generating units that are dispatched down or dispatched off. In 
connection with the consultation required by this paragraph, the affected parties shall, as necessary, enter 
into nondisclosure agreements protecting commercially sensitive information from unlimited disclosure in 
order to facilitate the development of construction schedules designed to minimize the financial impact on 
the affected parties.  
 
Where requests received by the ISO are for interconnection to the MTF or OTF, the responsibilities under 
Section II.47.1 of the Tariff will be solely within the MTO’s or OTO’s discretion. If the MTO or OTO acts 
to interconnect transmission facilities to its MTF or OTF, it will consult and coordinate with the ISO prior 
to completion of any system impact studies and facilities studies in connection with such interconnection 
requests. Likewise, the ISO will consult with the MTO or OTO on any proposed interconnection requests 
that may adversely affect the MTF or OTF. Nothing in this Tariff shall preclude the ISO from entering into 
an agreement(s) with the MTO or OTO for such MTO or OTO, pursuant to the ISO’s supervision, to 
perform system impact studies and facilities studies in connection with any interconnection requests. All 
interconnections to MTF or OTF must conform to the pro forma interconnection rules and procedures on 
file with the Commission for the ISO. Nothing in this Tariff shall preclude the performance of studies 
related to the interconnection of generating units by a third party consultant to the extent permitted by 
applicable procedures in this OATT (including procedures governing the treatment of confidential 
information) and provided that such studies performed by any third party consultant must include the 
MTO’s or OTO’s reasonable estimates of the costs of upgrades to such MTO’s MTF or OTO’s OTF needed 
to implement the conclusions of such studies and the MTO’s or OTO’s reasonable anticipated schedule for 
the construction of such upgrades.  
 
 
 
II.47.5 Interconnection of Elective Transmission Upgrades: Any entity may undertake the design, 
construction and interconnection of an Elective Transmission Upgrade (“Elective Transmission Upgrade 
Interconnection Customer”). In undertaking the design, construction and interconnection of an Elective 
Transmission Upgrade, the Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Customer shall comply with 
and be subject to the ISO New England Operating Documents, including, but not limited to, the 
Interconnection Procedures contained in Schedule 25 of this OATT and shall enter into an Interconnection

ETU with CNI Interconnection Service pursuant to Schedule 25 of this OATT shall be established as 
the total MW quantity of Capacity Supply Obligation(s) obtained by its associated New Import 
Capacity Resource(s) in the summer and winter periods, respectively.  
 
At the time of its establishment pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the CNI Capability shall not 
exceed the maximum net MW electrical capability at the Point of Interconnection and shall not 
exceed applicable seasonal equipment ratings determined pursuant to industry standards and 
consistent with the specifications described in ISO New England Planning and Operating Procedures. 
 
II.48.2 Establishing NR Capability and NI Capability 
(a) NR Capability shall be established as follows: Section 5.2.4 of Schedule 22 and Section 1.6.4.4 of 
Schedule 23 of this OATT describe the establishment of NR Capability for a Generating Facility that 
was treated as an Existing Generating Capacity Resource in the fourth Forward Capacity Auction. In 
Effective Date: 1/22/2020 - Docket #: ER20-450-000 
all other cases, summer and winter NR Capability for a Generating Facility shall be established as the 
Generating Facility’s maximum net MW electrical output at the Point of Interconnection at an 
ambient temperature at or above 50 degrees F for summer and at or above 0 degrees F for winter. A 
Generating Facility’s summer and winter NR Capability shall be equal to or greater than its summer 
and winter CNR Capability, respectively. 
(b) NI Capability shall be established as follows: For an External ETU with NI Interconnection Service 
pursuant to Schedule 25 of this OATT, summer and winter NI Capability shall be established as the 
maximum net MW electrical capability at the Point of Interconnection and shall not exceed applicable 
seasonal equipment ratings determined pursuant to industry standards and consistent with the 
specifications described in ISO New England Planning and Operating Procedures. An External ETU’s 
summer and winter NI Capability shall be equal to or greater than its summer and winter CNI 
Capability, respectively. 
 
II.48.3 Reductions to CNR Capability and CNI Capability: CNR Capability and CNI Capability shall 
be reduced as follows upon partial or full exit from the Forward Capacity Market as a result of any of the 
following actions: (1) a voluntary or mandatory termination pursuant to Section III.13.3.4A of the Tariff 
results in a reduction to summer and winter CNR Capability (or summer and winter CNI Capability) 
equal to the respective reduction to summer and winter Qualified Capacity described in III.13.3.4A; (2) 
the failure of the Import Capacity Resource(s) associated with an External ETU to offer into a Forward 
Capacity Auction in a MW quantity equal to the CNI Capability of the External ETU, as described in 
Section III.13.1.3 of the Tariff, results in a reduction to summer and winter CNI Capability equal to the 
respective reduction to summer and winter Capacity Network Import Interconnection Service described in 
Section III.13.1.3; (3) a failure to operate commercially for a period of three calendar years resulting in 
retirement pursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5.3(d) of the Tariff results in a reduction of summer and winter 
CNR Capability (or summer and winter CNI Capability) to zero; (4) a full exit from the Forward Capacity 
Market as the result of the operation of a Retirement De-List Bid or a Permanent De-List Bid, described 
in Section III.13.2.5.2.5.3 of the Tariff, and/or a substitution auction demand bid, described in Section 
III.13.2.8 of the Tariff, results in a reduction of summer and winter CNR Capability (or summer and 
winter CNI Capability) to zero; and a partial exit from the Forward Capacity Market as the result of the 
operation of a Retirement De-List Bid or a Permanent De-List Bid and/or a substitution auction demand 
bid results in a reduction of CNR Capability (or CNI Capability) as described below.  
 
(a)  Summer CNR/CNI Capability Following Partial Exit Resulting From De-List Bid and/or 
Effective Date: 1/22/2020 - Docket #: ER20-450-000 
Substitution Auction Demand Bid: Following the partial permanent exit from the Forward Capacity 
Market of a Generating Capacity Resource (or an Import Capacity Resource associated with an 
External ETU) as a result of the operation of a de-list bid and/or a substitution auction demand bid, 
the summer CNR Capability of the associated Generating Facility (or the summer CNI Capability of 
the associated External ETU) shall be reduced to equal (1) the associated summer Qualified Capacity 
(or, where there is more than one Import Capacity Resource associated with an External ETU, the 
sum of the associated summer Qualified Capacities) for the Forward Capacity Auction in which the 
partial exit occurred minus (2) the MW quantity that exited the Forward Capacity Market.  
 
(b) Winter CNR/CNI Capability Following Partial Exit Resulting From De-List Bid and/or 
Substitution Auction Demand Bid: Following the partial permanent exit from the Forward Capacity 
Market of a Generating Capacity Resource (or an Import Capacity Resource associated with an 
External ETU) as a result of the operation of a de-list bid and/or a substitution auction demand bid, 
the winter CNR Capability of the associated Generating Facility (or the winter CNI Capability of the 
associated External ETU) shall be reduced to equal (1) the Generating Facility’s summer CNR 
Capability (or the External ETU’s summer CNI Capability) reduced as described in subsection (a) of 
this Section II.48.3 multiplied by (2) the ratio of the associated winter Qualified Capacity (or, where 
there is more than one Import Capacity Resource associated with an External ETU, the sum of the 
associated winter Qualified Capacities) to the associated summer Qualified Capacity (or, where there 
is more than one Import Capacity Resource associated with an External ETU, the sum of the 
associated summer Qualified Capacities) for the Forward Capacity Auction in which the partial exit 
occurred; provided that a different winter CNR Capability value may be established to account for 
winter capability remaining after the removal of summer capability if the ISO determines that 
engineering information submitted no later than 10 calendar days after the conclusion of the Forward 
Capacity Auction supports the use of the different value.  
 
II.48.4 Reductions to NR Capability and NI Capability: NR Capability and NI Capability shall be 
reduced as follows for Generating Facilities and External ETUs as a result of any of the following actions: 
(1) a partial or full voluntary retirement results in partial or full reduction of NR Capability or NI 
Capability; (2) a failure to operate commercially for a period of three calendar years (as described in 
Section III.13.2.5.2.5.3(d) of the Tariff) results in a reduction of NR Capability or NI Capability to zero; 
(3) a full retirement of a Generating Facility or an External ETU as the result of the operation of a 
Retirement De-List Bid or an unconditional Permanent De-List Bid (as described in Section 
III.13.1.2.4.1(a) and Section III.13.2.5.2.5.3 of the Tariff) and/or a substitution auction demand bid (as 
Effective Date: 1/22/2020 - Docket #: ER20-450-000 
described in Section III.13.2.8 of the Tariff) results in a reduction of NR Capability or NI Capability to 
zero; and a partial retirement as the result of the operation of a Retirement De-List Bid or an 
unconditional Permanent De-List Bid and/or a substitution auction demand bid results in a reduction of 
NR Capability or NI Capability as described below. 
  
(a) Summer NR/NI Capability Following Partial Retirement Resulting From De-List Bid and/or 
Substitution Auction Demand Bid: Following the partial retirement of a Generating Facility (or an 
External ETU) as a result of the operation of a de-list bid and/or a substitution auction demand bid, 
the summer NR Capability of the Generating Facility (or summer NI Capability of the External ETU) 
shall be reduced to equal (1) the Generating Facility’s summer CNR Capability (or the External 
ETU’s summer CNI Capability) reduced as described in subsection (a) of Section II.48.3 multiplied 
by (2) the ratio of the Generating Facility’s summer NR Capability (or the External ETU’s summer 
NI Capability) prior to the Forward Capacity Auction to the Generating Facility’s summer CNR 
Capability (or the External ETU’s summer CNI Capability) prior to the Forward Capacity Auction. 
 
(b) Winter NR/NI Capability Following Partial Retirement Resulting From De-List Bid and/or 
Substitution Auction Demand Bid: Following the partial retirement of a Generating Facility (or an 
External ETU) as a result of the operation of a de-list bid and/or a substitution auction demand bid, 
the winter NR Capability of the Generating Facility (or winter NI Capability of the External ETU) 
shall be reduced to equal (1) the Generating Facility’s summer NR Capability (or the External ETU’s 
summer NI Capability) reduced as described in subsection (a) of this Section II.48.4 multiplied by (2) 
the ratio of the Generating Facility’s winter NR Capability (or the External ETU’S winter NI 
Capability) prior to the Forward Capacity Auction to the Generating Facility’s summer NR Capability 
(or the External ETU’S summer NI Capability) prior to the Forward Capacity Auction; provided that 
a different winter NR Capability value may be established to account for winter capability remaining 
after the removal of summer capability if the ISO determines that engineering information submitted 
no later than 10 calendar days after the conclusion of the Forward Capacity Auction supports the use 
of the different value.  
 
However, if the resulting winter NR Capability (or winter NI Capability) is less than the Generating 
Facility’s winter CNR Capability (or External ETU’s winter CNI Capability), the winter NR 
Capability (or winter NI Capability) will be set equal to the winter CNR Capability (or winter CNI 
Capability). 
 
 
 
 
II.H.  OTHER TRANSMISSION PROVISIONS  
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
 
II.49  Definition of PTF  
PTF or Pool Transmission Facilities are the transmission facilities owned by PTOs, over which the ISO 
shall exercise Operating Authority in accordance with the terms set forth in the TOA, rated 69 kV or 
above required to allow energy from significant power sources to move freely on the New England 
Transmission System, and include:  
 
1.  
All transmission lines and associated facilities owned by PTOs rated 69 kV and above, except for 
lines and associated facilities that (i) were not built as Public Policy Transmission Upgrades or 
Longer-Term Transmission Upgrades and (ii) contribute little or no parallel capability to the PTF. 
The following do not constitute PTF:  
 
(a) 
Unless they were built as part of a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade or a Longer-Term 
Transmission Upgrade, 
i. 
Those lines and associated facilities which are required to serve local load only,  
 
ii. 
Generator leads, which are defined as radial transmission from a generation bus 
to the nearest point on the PTF; or  
 
iii. 
Lines that are normally operated open.  
 
(b) 
Lines and associated facilities that are classified as MTF or OTF.  
 
2. 
All Public Policy Transmission Upgrades and Longer-Term Transmission Upgrades that 
comprise transmission lines rated 115 kV or above, and associated facilities rated 115 kV or 
above, owned by PTOs, and identified pursuant to Attachment K to the OATT shall constitute 
PTF. 
 
3.  
Parallel linkages in network stations owned by PTOs (including substation facilities such as 
transformers, circuit breakers and associated equipment) interconnecting the lines which 
constitute PTF.  
 
4.  
If a PTOs with significant generation in its transmission and distribution system (initially 25 
MW) is connected to the New England Transmission System and none of the transmission 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
facilities owned by the PTO qualify to be included in PTF as defined in (1), (2) and (3) above, 
then such PTO’s connection to PTF will constitute PTF if both of the following requirements are 
met for this connection:  
 
(a) 
The connection is rated 69 kV or above. 
 
(b) 
The connection is the principal transmission link between the PTO and the remainder of 
the PTF network.  
 
5.  
Rights of way and land owned by PTOs required for the installation of facilities that constitute 
PTF under (1), (2), (3) or (4) above.  
 
The ISO shall review at least annually the status of transmission lines and associated facilities and 
determine whether such facilities constitute PTF and shall prepare and keep current a schedule or 
catalogue of PTF facilities.  
 
The following examples indicate the intent of the above definitions:  
 
Unless they were built as part of a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade or Longer-Term 
Transmission Upgrade, radial tap lines to local load are excluded.  
 
Lines which loop, from two geographically separate points on the PTF, the supply to a load bus 
from the PTF are included.  
 
Lines which loop, from two geographically separate points on the PTF, the connections between a 
generator bus and the PTF are included.  
 
Radial connections or connections from a generating station to a single substation or switching 
station on the PTF are excluded, unless the requirements of paragraph (2) or (4) above are met.  
 
Transmission facilities owned or supported by a Related Person of a PTO which are rated 69 kV or above 
and are required to allow Energy from significant power sources to move freely on the New England 
Transmission System shall also constitute PTF provided (i) such Related Person files with the ISO its 
consent to such treatment; and (ii) the ISO determines that treatment of the facilities as PTF will facilitate 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
accomplishment of the ISO’s objectives. If such facilities constitute PTF pursuant to this paragraph, they 
shall be treated as “owned” or “supported,” as applicable, by a PTO for purposes of this OATT and the 
other provisions of the TOA, including the ability to include the cost associated with such PTF and any 
Transmission Support Expenses for support of PTF made by its Related Person in that PTO’s Annual 
Transmission Revenue Requirements, pursuant to Attachment F of the OATT.  
 
Of those transmission facilities that are upgrades, modifications or additions, on and after January 1, 
2004, to the transmission system administered by the ISO under the Interim Independent System Operator 
Agreement, or to the New England Transmission System on or after the Operations Date, only those that: 
(i) are rated 115kV or above, and (ii) otherwise meet the non-voltage criteria specified in Section II.49 
shall be classified as PTF. Those transmission facilities that were PTF pursuant to the Restated NEPOOL 
Agreement on December 31, 2003, and any upgrades to such facilities that meet the criteria specified in 
Section II.49, shall remain classified as PTF for all purposes under this Tariff.  
 
II.50  Additions to or Upgrades of PTF
The possible need for an addition to or upgrade of PTF may be identified in connection with the planning
process of Attachment K of this OATT, an application or request for service under this OATT, or a request
for the installation of or material change to a generation or transmission facility, or may be separately
identified by an ISO committee under the Participants Agreement, a Market Participant or the ISO. In such
cases, a study, if necessary, to assess available transfer capability and, if necessary, a System Impact Study
and a Facility Study, shall be performed by the affected PTO(s) in whose Local Network(s) the addition or
upgrade would or might be effected or their designee(s), or the ISO, in the case of a System Impact Study,
or the ISO’s designee(s), with review of the study by the ISO if it does not perform the study. Studies to
assess available transfer capability and System Impact Studies and Facilities Studies shall be conducted, as
appropriate, in accordance with any affected PTO’s Local Service Schedule of this OATT, or in accordance
with the applicable methodology specified in Attachments C and D to this OATT, and the provisions of the
Local Service Schedules to this OATT or the applicable provisions of Attachments I and J to this OATT
shall apply, as appropriate, with respect to the payment of the costs of the study and the other matters
covered thereby.
Responsibility for the costs of new PTF or any modification or other upgrade of PTF shall be determined, to 
the extent applicable, in accordance with Parts II.B and II.C and Schedules 11 and 12 to this OATT, 
including without limitation the provisions relating to responsibility for the costs of new PTF or 
modifications or other upgrades to PTF exceeding regional system, regulatory or other public requirements 
set forth in Section (3)(b) of Schedule 11 and Schedule 12 to this OATT.  
Effective Date: 01/01/2018 - Docket # ER18-132-000 
SCHEDULE 1 
SCHEDULING, SYSTEM CONTROL AND DISPATCH SERVICE 
Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch Service is the service required to schedule at the regional level 
the movement of power through, out of, within, or into the New England Control Area. Local level service 
is provided by the PTOs under Schedule 21 to this OATT. For transmission service under this OATT, this 
Ancillary Service can be provided only by the ISO and the Transmission Customer must purchase this 
service from the ISO. Charges for Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch Service are to be based on the 
expenses incurred by the ISO, and by the individual PTOs in the operation of Local Control Center dispatch 
centers or otherwise, to provide these services. The expenses incurred by the ISO in providing these 
services recovered under Section IV of the OATT. A surcharge for the expenses incurred by PTOs in the 
provision of these services for transmission service over the PTF will be added to the Through or Out 
Service rate and to the Regional Network Service rate. Any Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch 
Service expenses for the provisions of these services for MTF Service shall be determined separately and 
assessed to Transmission Customers receiving MTF Service, in accordance with the arrangements between 
the Transmission Customers receiving MTF Service and the MTF Provider.  
The expenses incurred in providing Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch Service for transmission 
service over the PTF for each PTO will be determined by an annual calculation based on the previous 
calendar year’s data as shown, in the case of PTOs which are subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction, in 
the PTO’s FERC Form 1 report for that year, and shall be based on actual data in lieu of allocated data if 
specifically identified in the Form 1 report. The surcharge shall be redetermined annually as of June 1 in 
each year and shall be in effect for the succeeding twelve (12) months. The rate surcharge per kilowatt for 
each month is one-twelfth of the amount derived by dividing the total annual PTO expenses for providing 
the service by the sum of the average of the coincident Monthly Peaks (as defined in Section II.21.2) of all

The details for implementation of Schedule 1 for transmission service over the PTF shall be established in 
accordance with the Implementation Rule for Schedule 1 attached to this OATT.  
 
SCHEDULE 1 IMPLEMENTATION RULE 
 
This rule provides detail with respect to the calculation of the rate surcharge each year for Scheduling, 
System Control and Dispatch Service, which is defined in the OATT as the service required to schedule the 
movement of power through, out of, within, or into the New England Control Area over Pool Transmission 
Facilities (“PTF”). This service also includes the dispatch and security analysis of the system. Scheduling, 
System Control and Dispatch Service for transmission service over transmission facilities other than PTF is 
provided under Schedule 21 of the OATT. For transmission service under the OATT, this Ancillary Service 
will be provided by the ISO, and rates collected under Schedule 1 are based on expenses incurred by the 
Local Control Centers, and the PTOs (as described herein) in providing the necessary elements of this 
service to the ISO. All of the costs of the ISO for the provision of service under Schedule 1 will be 
recovered under Section IV of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff. Schedule 1 of the OATT is 
for collection only of the revenue requirements for Local Control Centers and PTOs for System Control and 
Dispatch Service. Any Transmission Customer taking Regional Network Service or Through or Out 
Service shall be subject to the rate surcharge calculated under Schedule 1 of the OATT as described in more 
detail in this rule below.  
 
The PTOs shall make an annual informational filing on or before July 31 of each year showing the Schedule 
1 rate surcharge to be utilized by the ISO in the billing of Schedule 1 Ancillary Service that will be in effect 
for the period beginning June 1 of that year through May 31 of the subsequent year. If there are any 
corrections made to the information reflected in the informational filing after it has been submitted, the 
PTOs would file corrections to the informational filing.  At least thirty (30) days before the informational 
filing is made with the Commission, the PTOs shall make available to Transmission Customers and any 
other interested parties a draft of the proposed filing for review and comment prior to the filing by posting 
such draft on the RTO NE website.  The filing of the informational filing does not reopen the formula rate 
set forth below for review, but rather is contestable only with respect to the accuracy of the information 
Effective Date: 01/01/2018 - Docket # ER18-132-000 
 
 
contained in the informational filing.  The ISO shall have the discretion to conduct audits of such charges, 
with advisory Stakeholder input on the scope of audit, including on any agreed-upon procedures to be used 
by the auditor. In this provision, the term “agreed-upon procedures” shall have the meaning afforded to it by 
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

SCHEDULE 2 
REACTIVE SUPPLY AND VOLTAGE CONTROL SERVICE 
 
In order to maintain transmission voltages on the New England Transmission System (for voltage 
constraints that are reflected in the ISO’s systems for operating the New England Transmission System or 
in the ISO New England Operating Procedures) within acceptable limits, Qualified Reactive Resources  
are operated to produce (or absorb) reactive power. Thus, VAR Service must be provided to support 
Regional Network Service and Through or Out Service on the New England Transmission System (both 
of which services have a direct impact on voltage constraints that are reflected in the ISO’s systems for 
operating the New England Transmission System or in the ISO New England Operating Procedures).  
The amount of VAR Service that must be supplied with respect to a Transmission Customer’s Regional 
Network Service and Through or Out Service will be determined based on the degree of dynamic reactive 
power support necessary to maintain transmission voltages within limits that are consistently adhered to 
in the operation of the New England Transmission System.  Additional detailed requirements regarding 
the processes used to collect data and calculate amounts due or payable under this Schedule 2 are 
described in the Ancillary Service Schedule 2 Business Procedure posted on the ISO website. 
Transmission Customers taking Local Service, MTF Service or OTF Service may also need to acquire 
voltage support services not otherwise provided under this Schedule 2 pursuant to Schedules 18, 20A or 
21 to this OATT, as appropriate.

Capability (SCC) represents the Summer (SCC-S) and Winter (SCC-W) Claimed 
Capability of a generating unit (or ISO approved combination of units in accordance with 
ISO New England Operating Procedures). Claimed Capability Ratings are the maximum 
dependable load carrying ability, in megawatts to three decimal places, of such unit or 
units, excluding capacity required for station use. SCC-S and SCC-W are the MW values 
of the Resource that will be used as billing determinants under this Tariff.  
 
b.  
A “Qualified Non-Generator Reactive Resource’s Seasonal Claimed Capability” shall be 
2.5 times the maximum dynamic reactive power capability on a lagging basis 
demonstrated by the Qualified Non-Generator Reactive Resource during the testing of its 
VAR Service capability consistent with ISO Procedures for measurement of such 
capability in megawatts to three decimal places.  
 
9.  
The “VAR Revenue Requirement” shall be the sum over a month of all Qualified 
Reactive Resources’ VAR Payments.  
 
10.  
A Qualified Reactive Resource’s VAR Payment shall equal (1/12) * (VAR CC

reactive capability data, as required in ISO Operating Documents, that is submitted to and 
approved by the ISO and then in effect adjusted for reactive power absorbed between the 
resource and its Point(s) of Interconnection.  
 
B.  
Lost Opportunity Cost (LOC)  
 
1. 
The LOC for generators that are dispatched down by, or at the request of, the ISO, or a 
Local Control Center for the purpose of providing VAR Service will be calculated 
pursuant to Market Rule 1.  
 
2. 
Qualified Non-Generator Reactive Resources shall be eligible for payment of the LOC 
for Qualified Non-Generator Reactive Resources that are dispatched down (pursuant to 
the authority established within written operating protocols developed under Section 
II.B.4) at the request of the ISO or a Local Control Center for the purpose of providing 
VAR Service. The LOC of such Qualified Non-Generator Reactive Resources will be 
calculated pursuant to procedures established at the time of approval of the equipment 
type pursuant to Section II.B and filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements 
of Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  
 
C.  
Cost of Energy Consumed (CEC)  
 
Effective Date: 10/1/19 - Docket #: ER19-2528-000 
1. 
The CEC associated with resources that are producing or absorbing reactive power at 
zero real power output at the request of the ISO or a Local Control Center for the purpose 
of providing VAR Service will equal the cost of the additional Energy to produce the 
reactive power and will be calculated in each hour as follows: CEC = (MWhUnit * (LMP 
or actual Energy cost), where the MWh Unit are calculated pursuant to the Ancillary 
Service Schedule 2 Business Procedure. The actual Energy cost applies only if the 
Energy is purchased through a bilateral contract.  
 
2. 
For the Chester SVC, or any other non-generator reactive resource, recovering its costs 
under another Tariff schedule, the CEC will be set to zero ($0), and the cost of Energy to 
supply reactive supply and voltage control from the resource will be treated as losses on 
the New England Transmission System.  
 
D.  
Cost of Energy Produced (CEP)  
 
1. 
The CEP associated with generating units that are brought on-line by the ISO or a Local 
Control Center for the purpose of providing VAR Service shall equal the portion of the 
total NCPC (as defined in Market Rule 1) to be paid that resource for a day that is 
attributed to the hour(s) during which the resource is run to provide VAR Service in 
accordance with Market Rule 1 and the ISO New England Operating Documents.  
 
2. 
Qualified Non-Generator Reactive Resources shall be eligible for payment of the CEP 
incurred by Qualified Non-Generator Reactive Resources for the purpose of providing 
VAR Service (pursuant to the authority established within written operating protocols 
developed under Section II.B.4). The CEP of such Qualified Non-Generator Reactive 
Resources shall be measured pursuant to procedures established at the time of approval of 
the equipment type pursuant to Section II.B and filed with the Commission pursuant to 
the requirements of Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  
 
V.  
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT FOR VAR SERVICE  
Where a non-generator source of VAR Service (i) responds to identified needs for dynamic reactive 
power on the New England Transmission System, as identified in the Regional System Plan, and (ii) is 
confirmed by the ISO as a dynamic reactive power resource that will meet the identified need, and (iii) 
such non-generator source of VAR Service meets the criteria to be a Qualified Non-Generator Reactive 
Effective Date: 10/1/19 - Docket #: ER19-2528-000 
Resource but cannot recover its costs of providing dynamic reactive power under Schedule 2, such non-
generator may submit a separate schedule to the ISO OATT to be filed with the Commission pursuant to 
the requirements of Section 205 of the Federal Power Act for a rate to be paid to allow such resource to 
recover its costs related to providing VAR Service. In such case, it shall not be considered a Qualified 
Non-Generator Reactive Resource under this Schedule 2 and its provision of VAR Service and payment 
shall be governed solely by such separate schedule filed with the Commission.

REGULATION AND FREQUENCY RESPONSE SERVICE 
 
Regulation and Frequency Response Service (automatic generator control or AGC) is necessary to provide 
for continuous balancing of resources (generation and interchange) with load, and for maintaining 
scheduled interconnection frequency at sixty cycles per second (60 Hz).  Regulation and Frequency 
Response Service is accomplished by committing on-line generation whose output is raised or lowered 
(predominantly through the use of automatic generating control equipment) and by other non-generation 
resources capable of providing this service as necessary to follow the moment-by-moment changes in load.  
The obligation to maintain this balance between resources and load lies with the ISO and this service will be 
available to all Transmission Customers that have a load obligation in the New England Markets pursuant 
to Market Rule 1. The Transmission Customer must either take this service from the ISO through the New 
England Markets or make alternative comparable arrangements to satisfy its Regulation and Frequency 
Response Service obligation.  The ISO will take into account the speed and accuracy of regulation 
resources in its determination of Regulation and Frequency Response reserve requirements, including as it 
reviews whether a self-supplying Transmission Customer has made alternative comparable arrangements.  
Upon request by the self-supplying Transmission Customer, the ISO will share with the Transmission 
Customer its reasoning and any related data used to make the determination of whether the Transmission 
Customer has made alternative comparable arrangements.

TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION RELATED UPGRADE COSTS 
(1) 
 Classification of Generating Projects. The treatment for purposes of this OATT of the Generator 
Interconnection Related Upgrade costs with respect to the facilities needed for the interconnection 
of a particular new or modified generating unit project in accordance with Section II.47 of this 
OATT depends on whether the project is a Category A Project, a Category B Project or a Category 
C Project, as follows:  
(a) 
A Category A Project is one whose Generator Owner committed to pay for upgrade costs 
on or after October 1, 1998 and prior to October 29, 1998 and has filed a petition with the 
Commission requesting that the costs associated with the interconnection of its generation 
project be determined in accordance with Schedule 11 of this OATT, as evidenced either 
by the filing of an executed Transmission Service Agreement or by the filing of an 
unexecuted Transmission Service Agreement.  
(b) 
A Category B Project is any one whose Generator Owner committed to pay for upgrade 
costs on or after October 29, 1998 and prior to June 22, 1999, as evidenced either by the 
filing of an executed Transmission Service Agreement or by the filing of an unexecuted 
Transmission Service Agreement. To the extent not otherwise covered by the preceding 
sentence, a Category B Project includes any one (other than a Category A Project) on 
which the Generator Owner had expended at least $5,000,000, including amounts due 
under irrevocable commitments, as of June 22, 1999. Category B Projects are those 
projects listed as Category A Projects in Section 1(a) of this Schedule 11, but no longer 
qualify as Category A Projects, that had expended at least $5,000,000 (including amounts 
due under irrevocable commitments) as of June 22, 1999, as reasonably determined by the

Direct Interconnection Transmission Costs. Direct Interconnection Transmission Costs shall mean 
the cost of facilities constructed for sole use of the Generator Owner that are not PTF. One hundred 
percent of Direct Interconnection Transmission Costs shall be the responsibility of the Generator 
Owner whether the Generator Owner’s project is a Category A Project, a Category B Project or a 
Category C Project.  
 
(3)  
Treatment of Category A Project Transmission Costs. The allocation of costs of Generator 
Interconnection Related Upgrades for Category A Projects will be determined as follows:  
 
(d)  
One-half of the Shared Amount (as defined below) of the capital cost of the PTF upgrade 
shall constitute Pool Supported PTF and be included in Annual Transmission Revenue 
Requirements under Attachment F to this OATT. The Generator Owner shall be obligated 
to pay, in addition to the Direct Interconnection Transmission Costs, the other half of the 
Shared Amount of the capital cost of the PTF upgrade and all of the capital costs in excess 
Effective Date: 11/1/17 - Docket # ER17-2421-000  
 
of the Shared Amount, and any applicable tax gross-up amounts, and such amounts to be 
paid by the Generator Owner shall not be included in Annual Transmission Revenue 
Requirements under Attachment F to this OATT. Following completion of the 
construction or modification of the Generator Interconnection Related Upgrade, the 
Generator Owner shall be obligated to pay its pro rata share of all of the annual costs 
(including cost of capital, federal and state income taxes, O&M and A&G expenses, annual 
property taxes and other related costs) which are allocable to such upgrade, pursuant to the 
interconnection agreement with the individual PTO or its designee which is responsible for 
the construction or modification, and such agreement may be filed with the Commission by 
the PTO, either signed or unsigned, on its own or at the request of the Generator Owner.  
 
(e)  
In determining the cost responsibilities related to a Generator Interconnection Related 
Upgrade to PTF, the ISO may determine that all or a portion of the proposed facilities 
exceed regional system, regulatory or other public requirements. In such a case, the ISO 
shall determine the amount of the excess costs of the Generator Interconnection Related 
Upgrade which shall be borne by the entity which is responsible for requiring such excess 
costs, and the excess costs shall not be included in the calculation of the Shared Amount.  
 
(f)  
The Shared Amount of the capital cost of the Generator Interconnection Related Upgrade 
of PTF shall be initially determined as of the time that the System Impact Study agreement 
is executed by all parties and the Generator Owner has paid the cost of the study (such 
initial determination to be based on the estimated cost of the Generator Interconnection 
Related Upgrade, subject to later adjustment as set forth below) subject to truing up the 
KW element of the following formula upon completion of the Generator Interconnection 
Upgrade, and shall be the lesser of (1) the full actual capital cost of the Generator 
Interconnection Related Upgrade of PTF (excluding any costs which are determined to be 
excess costs in accordance with paragraph (b) above) or (2) the amount determined in 
accordance with the following formula:  
 
P= (KW x R x 0.50)/C  
 
in which:  
 
Effective Date: 11/1/17 - Docket # ER17-2421-000

is the maximum amount to be shared;  
 
KW  
in the case of a generating unit, is the actual demonstrated net capability of the new 
generating unit or increase in the capacity of an existing generating unit corrected 
to 50°F in kilowatts. If winter operating conditions are shown in the System 
Impact Study and/or application under Section 3.9 of Section I of the 
Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff to require additional transmission 
reinforcements beyond those reinforcements required for summer operating 
conditions, the net capability of the unit will be corrected to an ambient air 
temperature of 0°F;  
 
R  
is the Pool PTF Rate in effect on the Compliance Effective Date, which is $15.57 
per kilowatt year, adjusted to reflect compliance with the April 5, 1999 Settlement 
Agreement, approved by the Commission by order dated July 30, 1999 in Docket

All payments required hereunder shall be determined initially on an estimated basis, and 
then adjusted after the appropriate portion of the construction or modification costs has 
been reflected in OATT rates in the first adjustment of OATT rates after the upgrade has 
been placed in commercial operation.  
 
(h)  
The provisions in this Section (3) with respect to allocation of costs for Generator  
Interconnection Related Upgrades of PTF for Category A projects are subject to further 
clarifications and/or modifications to reflect the outcome of proceedings in Commission 
Docket Nos. ER98-3853 (including any court appeals) and EL00-62-000, et al., and further 
Commission orders with respect thereto.  
 
Effective Date: 11/1/17 - Docket # ER17-2421-000  
 
(4)  
Treatment of Category B Project Transmission Costs. The costs of Generator Interconnection 
Related Upgrades in connection with a Category B Project shall be allocated in the same way as 
Generator Interconnection Related Upgrades for Category A projects.  
 
(5)  
Treatment of Category C Project Transmission Costs. If a Generator Interconnection Related 
Upgrade or an Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Related Upgrade (collectively, 
“Upgrade”) is required in order to satisfy the Capacity Capability Interconnection Standard or the 
Network Capability Interconnection Standard (or its predecessor standard) in connection with a 
Category C Project, the Generator Owner or Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection 
Customer (“ETU IC”), as applicable, shall be obligated to pay all of the cost of such Upgrade, 
including all Direct Interconnection Transmission Costs and any applicable tax gross-up amounts, 
to the extent such costs would not have been incurred but for the interconnection; provided that, if 
the ISO determines that a particular Upgrade provides benefits to the system as a whole as well as 
to particular parties, then the cost of such Upgrade shall be allocated in the same way as Reliability 
Transmission Upgrades.  If the Upgrade consists of Interconnecting Transmission Owner’s 
Interconnection Facilities, Network Upgrades, or Distribution Upgrades, including a Cluster 
Enabling Transmission Upgrade, that were identified under Clustering and are not included in 
Direct Interconnection Transmission Costs, then the costs to be paid by each Generator Owner or 
ETU IC (that is not the ETU IC for an ETU that is taking the place of a CETU, or portion thereof, 
pursuant to Section 4.2.3.4 of Schedule 22, Section 1.5.3.3.3.4 of Schedule 23, or Section 4.2.3.4 of 
Schedule 25, Section II of the Tariff) with an Interconnection Request included in the cluster shall 
be the total costs of such Upgrade multiplied by the ratio of the Generator Owner or ETU IC’s 
respective distribution impact divided by the total distribution impact of the entire cluster based on 
the following distribution factor cost allocation methodology. 
 
 
Distribution Factor Cost Allocation Methodology:  The distribution factor is the measure of 
responsiveness or change in electrical loading on system facilities due to a change in electric power 
transfer from one part of the electric system to another, expressed in percent of the change in power 
transfer.  The calculation of the distribution factor for each of the eligible Upgrades shall:  (i) use 
the final CSIS Study Case for summer peak load conditions; (ii) use the pre-contingency condition 
(i.e., no contingencies will be modeled); and, (iii) be conducted using a transfer from the injection 
point associated with the respective Generator Owner or ETU IC’s facility to New England Control 
Area load.  The distribution impact of each Generator Owner or ETU IC with an Interconnection 
Effective Date: 11/1/17 - Docket # ER17-2421-000  
 
Request included in the cluster shall be determined by multiplying the Generator Owner or ETU 
IC’s respective distribution factor, as calculated above, by the Summer Network Resource 
Capability in the case of a Generating Facility or the absolute value of the higher of the requested 
bidirectional capability that results in a positive distribution factor in the case of an Elective 
Transmission Upgrade.  The total distribution impact of the entire cluster shall be the sum of all of 
the individual distribution impacts for the Generator Owners and ETU ICs with Interconnection 
Requests included in the cluster. 
 
 
Where cost allocation for an Upgrade identified under Clustering cannot be determined using the 
distribution factor cost allocation methodology (e.g., a dynamic reactive device), each Generator 
Owner or ETU IC with an Interconnection Request included in the cluster shall be obligated to pay 
the costs of such Upgrade based upon its pro rata megawatt share of the Interconnection Requests 
included in the cluster study to be determined using the Summer Network Resource Capability in 
the case of a Generating Facility and the absolute value of the higher of the requested bidirectional 
capability in the case of an Elective Transmission Upgrade. 
 
 
 
Following completion of the construction or modification, the Generator Owner or ETU IC shall be 
obligated to pay all (or, in the case of an Upgrade identified under Clustering, its share) of the 
annual costs (including federal and state income taxes, O&M and A&G expenses, annual property 
taxes and other related costs) which are allocable to the Upgrade, pursuant to the interconnection 
agreement (or support agreement) with the individual PTO or its designee which is responsible for 
the construction or modification, and such agreement may be filed with the Commission by the 
PTO, either signed or unsigned, on its own or at the request of the Generator Owner or ETU IC.   
 
A Generator Owner with a Generating Facility or ETU IC with an Elective Transmission Upgrade 
that achieves Commercial Operation within ten years of the In-Service Date of a Cluster Enabling 
Transmission Upgrade (to be referred to as a “Late Comer Project”) shall reimburse the entities 
(i.e., Generator Owner or ETU IC) that have contributed to the costs of the Cluster Enabling 
Transmission Upgrade by the amount of said entities’ corresponding reduction in Cluster Enabling 
Transmission Upgrade costs based on the comparison of the Cluster Enabling Transmission 
Upgrade cost allocation with and without the added Late Comer Project, if the Late Comer Project:  
(i) interconnects directly to the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade, (ii) connects to a 
Effective Date: 11/1/17 - Docket # ER17-2421-000 
substation where the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade terminates, or (iii) (a) is greater than 
five megawatt and is greater than one percent of the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade 
normal rating, and (b) (1) has an impact on the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade that is 
greater than five percent of the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade normal rating or (2) has a 
distribution factor on the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade that is greater than or equal to 20 
percent using the distribution factor methodology described above.  A Generator Owner or ETU 
IC that has contributed to the costs of the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade shall have the 
payments associated with the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade adjusted based on the 
depreciation schedule that is being used for the Cluster Enabling Transmission Upgrade.  
(6) 
Treatment of Elective Transmission Upgrades for Generating Units. If a Generator Owner has 
requested an Elective Transmission Upgrade pursuant to Section II.47 of this OATT in connection 
with a new or materially changed generation unit, the Generator Owner shall be subject to the cost, 
credit assurance and contract obligations set forth in Section II.47 of this OATT and Schedule 12 to 
this OATT for Elective Transmission Upgrades.  
(7) 
Contract and Credit Requirements. If a Generator Interconnection Related Upgrade or an Elective 
Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Related Upgrade (collectively, “Upgrade”) is required, the 
Generator Owner or Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Customer (“ETU IC”) 
requesting such upgrade, at the request of the PTO or its designee responsible for effecting the 
construction or modification, shall be obligated to pay to the PTO or its designee responsible for 
effecting the Upgrade an amount equal to its share of the estimated cost of the construction at one 
time or in monthly or other periodic installments, including, without limitation, all costs associated 
with acquiring land, rights of way easements, purchasing equipment and materials, installing, 
constructing, interconnecting, and testing the facilities; O&M and engineering costs; all related 
overheads; and any and all associated taxes and government fees. In addition to, or in lieu of said 
payment, the affected PTO or its designee may require the Generator Owner or ETU IC to provide, 
as security for its obligation to pay any unfunded balance of the construction costs, a letter of credit 
or other reasonable form of security acceptable to the PTO or its designee that will be responsible 
for the construction equivalent to the cost of the upgrade including taxes and consistent with 
relevant commercial practices, as established by the Uniform Commercial Code. As soon as 
reasonably practical, but in any event within 180 days after completion of the construction or 
modifications, or as otherwise mutually agreed, the PTO or its designee responsible for the 
Effective Date: 11/1/17 - Docket # ER17-2421-000 
construction or modification will determine the difference, if any, between the estimated cost 
already paid by the Generator Owner or ETU IC to the PTO or its designee responsible for the 
construction or modification and its share of the actual cost of the construction or modification, and 
will either receive from the Generator Owner or ETU IC, with Interest (if the sum paid is 
insufficient) or pay to the Generator Owner or ETU IC, with Interest (if the sum paid is surplus) the 
difference; provided that if, at the time such determination is made, items of construction that 
remain to be completed and/or some construction costs have not been invoiced and paid, the PTO 
or its designee responsible for the construction or modification shall continue to be entitled to 
recover from the Generator Owner or ETU IC the Generator Owner or ETU IC’s share of the costs 
of such remaining items and may retain a reserve to cover such items. Furthermore, the PTO shall 
release any letter of credit or other security instrument received by the PTO, up to the amount 
allowed to be recovered through the PTO’s Annual Transmission Revenue Requirement for 
Category A and B Projects, no later than sixty (60) days after the later of the reflection of such costs 
in the regional rates and the commercial operation of the Generating Facility or Elective 
Transmission Upgrade addition or modification. To the extent Upgrades, or any portion thereof, are 
completed in a calendar year, PTO will use their best efforts to reflect such facilities in their Annual 
Transmission Revenue Requirements calculated on the basis of that year. That portion of the 
construction or modification costs or deposit paid by the Generator Owner or ETU IC may, by 
mutual agreement of the PTO and the Generator Owner or ETU IC, either be retained by the PTO, 
or be refunded to the Generator Owner or ETU IC upon the Generator Owner or ETU IC executing 
a contract with the PTO obligating the Generator Owner or ETU IC to pay the PTO the ongoing 
transmission revenue requirement associated with its share of the Upgrade, including but not 
limited to cost of capital, federal and state income taxes, O&M and A&G costs, annual property 
taxes and all other related costs, and providing the PTO with an irrevocable letter of credit or other 
form of security acceptable to the PTO. In the event the Generator Owner or ETU IC’s portion of 
the construction or modification costs is retained by the PTO or its designee in accordance with the 
preceding sentence, the Generator Owner or ETU IC will be obligated (i) to pay the federal and 
state income taxes required to be paid by the PTO with respect to the retained amount, and (ii) to 
pay annually its percentage of the O&M and A&G costs, annual property taxes and all other related 
costs, except for those costs required to be paid under (i) or any costs that are retained by the PTO in 
accordance with the interconnection agreement. If the Generator Owner or ETU IC for whatever 
reason goes out of business, or otherwise abandons its Generating Facility or Elective Transmission 
Upgrade project and the Upgrade has already been partially or completely constructed, the 
Effective Date: 11/1/17 - Docket # ER17-2421-000 
Generator Owner or ETU IC shall be responsible for all of the unrecovered ongoing costs of the 
upgrade that would not have been incurred but for the proposed generation or ETU project. Nothing 
contained herein shall prevent the PTO or its designee responsible for the construction or 
modification and the Generator Owner or ETU IC from negotiating other methods for providing 
financial security associated with the cost of an upgrade deemed acceptable to the PTO or other 
entity. Subject to the foregoing, the interconnection and support agreements for an Upgrade may 
specify the basis for continued support of such upgrade in the event of the cancellation of the 
project due to a failure to obtain regulatory approvals or permits or required rights of way or other 
property, or action to terminate the project before its completion for whatever reason and any other 
matters.  
Interest payable hereunder shall be calculated in accordance with Section II.8.3 of the OATT.

Upgrades.   
 
(b) 
The remaining thirty percent of the costs of each Public Policy Transmission Upgrade shall be 
allocated to the Regional Network Load of each state in direct proportion to the state’s share of the public 
policy planning need that gives rise to the Public Policy Transmission Upgrade (“Planning Need”). Each 
state’s share of the Planning Need shall be: (i) as shown in a Planning Need identified by NESCOE in a 
request for a Public Policy Transmission Study pursuant to Section 4A.1 of Attachment K, based on its 
estimate of the MWhs of electric energy (or MWs of capacity, if applicable) needed over the requested 
study period to satisfy the state and federal Public Policy Requirements it identified for evaluation and 
how such needs are allocated among the states, which shall take into account the MWhs (or MWs of 
capacity, if applicable) associated with contracts and other mechanisms that are available and capable to 
satisfy the Public Policy Requirements for the year or years of need considered in the requested Public 
Policy Transmission Study; or (ii) if NESCOE does not provide a Planning Need in such a request, the 
load-ratio share of the Regional Network Load of each state that has been identified pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in Sections 4A.1 and 4A.1.1 of Attachment K as having one or more Public Policy 
Requirements that will be evaluated in the corresponding Public Policy Transmission Study.  Nothing in 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000

threshold:  The cost of Longer-Term Transmission Upgrades shall be allocated in the same 
manner as Regional Benefit Upgrades, unless the applicable PTOs in accordance with the TOA or 
a Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor that is not a PTO in accordance with the NTDOA files 
with the Commission an alternative cost allocation for a Longer-Term Transmission Upgrade that 
implements the cost allocation requested by NESCOE in a written communication to the ISO 
pursuant to Section 16.4(i) of Attachment K to this OATT and the Commission approves such 
alternative cost allocation, in which case:  (a) only the portion of the costs associated with 
addressing any combined reliability and/or market efficiency needs identified in the request for 
proposal(s) issued pursuant to Section 16.4(a) of Attachment K to this OATT, as calculated by 
the ISO, shall be allocated in the same manner as Regional Benefit Upgrades; and (b) the 
incremental costs associated with addressing the longer-term needs identified in a request for 
proposal(s) issued pursuant to Section 16.4(a) of Attachment K to this OATT shall be allocated 
under the alternative cost allocation filed with and accepted by the Commission by the applicable 
PTO in accordance with the TOA or by a Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor that is not a 
PTO in accordance with the NTDOA. 
 
(b) Longer-Term Transmission Upgrades that do not meet the greater than 1.0 benefit-to-cost ratio 
threshold:  A portion of the cost of the Longer-Term Transmission Upgrades determined by 
multiplying the benefit-to-cost ratio, as calculated pursuant to Section 16.4(h) of Attachment K to 
this OATT, by the total cost of the Longer-Term Transmission Upgrades shall be allocated in the 
same manner as Regional Benefit Upgrades.  The remaining portion of the cost of the Longer-
Term Transmission Upgrades shall be allocated to Regional Network Load in each of the New 
England states that voluntarily agree to fund the remaining portion of the cost in accordance with 
the cost allocation that may be filed by the applicable PTO pursuant to the TOA or a Qualified 
Transmission Project Sponsor that is not a PTO pursuant to the NTDOA that implements the cost 
allocation requested by NESCOE in a written communication to the ISO pursuant to Section 
16.4(j) of Attachment K to this OATT and is approved by the Commission.

SCHEDULE 12C 
DETERMINATION OF LOCALIZED COSTS ON AND AFTER JANUARY 1, 2004 
 
Introduction  
The purpose of this Schedule 12C is to describe procedures that the ISO will use in determining Localized 
Costs for eligible Transmission Upgrades as specified below on or after January 1, 2004.  
 
Review and Approval  
These Schedule 12C review and approval procedures are separate and distinct from any other approval 
procedures within the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff and are not a condition for receiving 
approval under any other section of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff. If submission of a 
proposed plan for a Transmission Upgrade by a Market Participant or Transmission Owner for review 
pursuant to Section I.3.9 of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff is required, then the approval 
for Transmission Upgrade cost allocations as described under this Schedule 12C of this OATT cannot 
occur sooner than after that review has been completed and it has been determined, pursuant to Section 
I.3.9 of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff, that the Market Participant or Transmission 
Owner is free to proceed with implementation of the proposed Transmission Upgrade.  
 
Entities conducting transmission system studies shall review and discuss transmission design and 
construction alternatives as they are developed under a System Impact Study (“SIS”) or as part of the 
Regional System Plan with the System Operator, Reliability Committee and the Planning Advisory 
Committee, as deemed appropriate by the ISO.  
 
1.  
Review Procedures For Determining Localized Costs  
All (1) RTEP02 Upgrades; (2) Regional Benefit Upgrades developed pursuant to Section 4.2 of 
Attachment K of the OATT; (3) reconstructions/replacements of all or part of Pool Transmission 
Facilities; and (4) Regional Benefit Upgrades, Public Policy Transmission Upgrades, and Longer-Term 
Transmission Upgrades developed pursuant to Sections 4.3, 4A, and 16 (respectively) of Attachment K of 
the OATT shall be reviewed by the ISO with advisory input from the Reliability Committee to determine 
if any of the costs associated with such upgrades are Localized Costs, except that a proposed 
Transmission Upgrade which costs less than $500,000 may be exempted from this review by the ISO. 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
The ISO, with advisory input from the Reliability Committee, will review and update, as appropriate, the 
$500,000 threshold on an annual basis.  
 
The Market Participant or Transmission Owner seeking cost recovery for a proposed Transmission 
Upgrade, including reconstruction or replacement, shall submit to the ISO and the Reliability Committee 
the following information as deemed appropriate by the ISO:  
 
(a)  
A description of (i) the proposed Transmission Upgrade and any feasible and practical 
transmission alternatives that were considered, and (ii) the most currently available study grade or 
better estimates of the construction, including the potential impact on the bulk power system 
during the construction of such upgrade, and (iii) the operating costs of the proposed 
Transmission Upgrade and any feasible and practical transmission alternatives that were 
considered.  
 
(b)  
A summary of the technical analysis performed for the Transmission Upgrade and the identified 
transmission alternatives.  
 
(c)  
A review and discussion of the need for the proposed Transmission Upgrade.  
 
(d)  
A discussion of why the requested Transmission Upgrade was selected over other transmission 
alternatives, with a description of the benefits of the proposed Transmission Upgrade over other 
transmission alternatives from an operational, timing of implementation, cost and reliability 
perspective.  
 
If in reviewing the application and associated information, the ISO, with advisory input from the 
Reliability Committee, decides that additional information, review, or study is required prior to acting on 
the application, the ISO, with advisory input from the Reliability Committee, may elect to defer action 
and solicit supplementary information, review, or study as required. Sources for such additional 
information may be, but are not limited to, the entity sponsoring the application, Transmission Owners, or 
the Reliability Committee.  
 
In making its determination of whether Localized Costs exist for the Transmission Upgrades identified in 
(1), (2) and (3) above, the ISO will consider the reasonableness of the proposed engineering design and 
construction method with respect to (i) Good Utility Practice, (ii) the current engineering design and 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
construction practices in the area in which the Transmission Upgrade is built, (iii) alternate feasible and 
practical Transmission Upgrades and (iv) the relative costs, operation, timing of implementation, 
efficiency and reliability of the proposed Transmission Upgrades.  
 
In making its determination of whether Localized Costs exist for the Transmission Upgrades identified in 
(4) above, the ISO will consider incremental costs resulting from changes to the Transmission Upgrade 
described in the Transmission Cost Allocation application (or any revisions thereto) for regional rate 
recovery compared to the description of the Transmission Upgrade in Schedule A to the Selected 
Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor Agreement.  Localized Costs for the Transmission Upgrades 
identified in (4) above that are located on a PTO’s existing transmission system, where the Selected 
Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor is not the PTO for the existing system element(s), will be 
determined in a manner consistent with the process described for the Transmission Upgrades identified in 
(1), (2) and (3) above.    
 
Local siting requirements for transmission facilities shall not be dispositive of whether or not Localized 
Costs exist with respect to any particular Transmission Upgrade.  
 
The ISO will develop detailed procedures to fulfill the objectives and requirements of this Schedule 12C.  
 
2.  
Additional Transmission Upgrade Costs or Design Changes Subsequent to the ISO’s 
Determination of Localized Costs  
If the costs associated with a Transmission Upgrade exceed the estimated Pool-Supported PTF costs 
determined in the original Localized Costs review by ten percent, or the design associated with the 
construction of a Transmission Upgrade is materially changed subsequent to the ISO’s determination of 
Localized Costs, then the applicant for Pool-Supported PTF costs shall be required to submit its 
Transmission Upgrade again to a review by the ISO to determine if any of the incremental costs or costs 
associated with the change in design are Localized Costs.  
 
3.  
Dispute Resolution Regarding Determination of Localized Costs  
The ISO’s determination of Localized Costs under this OATT shall take effect on the date on which the 
ISO issues its written findings and determination. The applicant for cost recovery (the “Applicant”) 
whose project is deemed to include Localized Costs may dispute such decision by the ISO by submitting 
within 60 days of such decision formal written notice of the dispute to the ISO, describing in detail the 
basis for its challenge of the ISO’s determination. The Applicant and the ISO shall then enter into good 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
faith negotiations for a period not to exceed 60 days from the date of the Applicant’s written notice to try 
to resolve the dispute.  
If there is no satisfactory resolution of the dispute at the end of the negotiation period, the Applicant shall 
then have the right to file a Section 206 complaint with the Commission.

SCHEDULE 15 
NORTHEASTERN INTERREGIONAL COST ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY 
 
I. 
Cost Allocation  
1. 
Costs of Approved Interregional Transmission Projects 
The cost allocation methodology reflected in this Section 1 shall be referred to as 
the “Northeastern Interregional Cost Allocation Methodology” (or “NICAM”), and shall not be 
modified without the mutual consent of the Section 205 rights holders in each region.   
The costs of approved Interregional Transmission Projects shall be allocated 
among the PJM, NYISO, and ISO-NE regions in accordance with the cost allocation principles 
of FERC Order No. 1000, as follows: 
(a) 
To be eligible for interregional cost allocation, an Interregional 
Transmission Project must be selected in the regional transmission plan for purposes of cost 
allocation in each of the transmission planning regions in which the transmission project is 
proposed to be located, pursuant to FERC accepted agreements and tariffs on file with FERC in 
each region.  With respect to Interregional Transmission Projects and other transmission projects 
involving NYISO and PJM, the cost allocation of such projects shall be in accordance with the 
Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”) among and between NYISO and PJM.  With respect to 
Interregional Transmission Projects and other transmission projects involving NYISO and ISO-
NE, the cost allocation for such projects shall be in accordance with the respective tariffs of 
NYISO and ISO-NE. 
(b) 
The share of the costs of an Interregional Transmission Project allocated 
to a region will be determined by the ratio of the present value of the estimated costs of such 
region’s displaced regional transmission project to the total of the present values of the estimated 
costs of the displaced regional transmission projects in all regions that have selected the 
Interregional Transmission Project in their regional transmission plans.  
(i) 
The present values of the estimated costs of each region’s 
displaced regional transmission project shall be based on a 
common base date that will be the beginning of the calendar month 
of the cost allocation analysis for the subject Interregional 
Transmission Project (the “Base Date”).  
(ii) 
In order to perform the analysis in this Section (b), the estimated 
cost of the displaced regional transmission projects shall specify 
the year’s dollars in which those estimates are provided.  
(iii) 
The present value analysis for all displaced regional transmission 
projects shall use a common discount rate. The regions having 
displaced projects will mutually agree, in consultation with their 
respective transmission owners, on the discount rate to be used for 
the present value analysis. 
(iv) 
In the IPSAC review process, the regions having displaced projects 
will review and determine, in consultation with their respective 
transmission owners, that reasonably comparable estimating 
procedures have been used prior to applying this cost allocation.  
(c) 
No cost shall be allocated to a region that has not selected the 
Interregional Transmission Project in its regional transmission plan. 
(d) 
If a portion of an Interregional Transmission Project evaluated under the 
Protocol is included by a region (Region 1) in its regional transmission plan, but there is no 
regional need or displaced regional transmission project in Region 1 and the neighboring  region 
(Region 2) has a regional need or displaced regional project for the Interregional Transmission 
Project and includes the Interregional Transmission Project in its regional transmission plan, all 
of the costs of the Interregional Transmission Project shall be allocated to Region 2 in 
accordance with the NICAM and none of the costs will be allocated to Region 1.  However, 
Region 1 may voluntarily agree, with the mutual consent of the Section 205 rights holders, in the 
affected regions (including the Long Island Power Authority and the New York Power Authority 
if in the NYISO region), to use an alternative cost allocation method filed with and accepted by 
the Commission. 
(e) 
 The portion of the costs allocated to a region pursuant to the NICAM 
shall be further allocated to that region’s transmission customers pursuant to the applicable 
provisions of the region’s FERC-filed documents and agreements. 
(f) 
 The following example illustrates the cost allocation for such an 
Interregional Transmission Project:  
• 
A cost allocation analysis of the costs of Interregional Transmission Project Z is 
to be performed during a given month establishing the beginning of that month as 
the Base Date. 
• 
Region A has identified a reliability need in its region and has selected a 
transmission project (Project X) as the preferred solution in its regional plan.  The 
estimated cost of Project X is: Cost (X), provided in a given year’s dollars. The 
number of years from the Base Date to the year associated with the cost estimate 
of Project (X) is:  N(X). 
• 
Region B has identified a reliability need in its region and has selected a 
transmission project (Project Y) as the preferred solution in its Regional Plan.  
The estimated cost of Project Y is: Cost (Y), provided in a given year’s dollars. 
The number of years from the Base Date to the year associated with the cost 
estimate of Project (Y) is:   N(Y). 
• 
Regions A and B, through the interregional planning process have determined that 
an Interregional Transmission Project (Project Z) will address the reliability needs 
in both regions more efficiently and cost-effectively than the separate regional 
projects.  The estimated cost of Project Z is:  Cost (Z). Regions A and  B have 
each determined that  Interregional Transmission Project Z is the preferred 
solution to their reliability needs and have adopted that Interregional  
Transmission  Project in their respective regional plans in lieu of Projects X and Y 
respectively. If Regions A and B have agreed to bear the costs of upgrades in 
other affected transmission planning regions, these costs will be considered part 
of Cost (Z).  
• 
The discount rate used for all displaced regional transmission projects is:  D 
• 
Based on the foregoing assumptions, the following formulas will be used:  
 Present Value of Cost (X) = PV Cost (X) = Cost (X) / (1+D)N(X) 
 Present Value of Cost (Y) = PV Cost (Y) = Cost (Y) / (1+D)N(Y) 
 Cost Allocation to Region A = Cost (Z) x PV Cost (X)/[PV Cost (X) + PV 
Cost (Y)] 
 Cost Allocation to Region B = Cost (Z) x PV Cost (Y)/[PV Cost (X) + PV 
Cost (Y)]  
• 
Applying those formulas, if:   
Cost (X) = $60 Million and N(X) = 8.25 years 
Cost (Y) = $40 Million and N(Y) = 4.50 years 
Cost (Z) = $80 Million  
D = 7.5%  per year  
Then:  
PV Cost (X) = 60/(1+0.075) 8.25   =  33.039 Million 
PV Cost (Y) = 40/(1+0.075)4.50     =  28.888 Million 
Cost Allocation to Region A = $80 x 33.039/(33.039 + 28.888) = $42,681 Million  
Cost Allocation to Region B = $80 x 28.888/(33.039+28.888) = $37.319 Million 
2. 
Other Cost Allocation Arrangements 
(a) 
Except as provided in Section 2.(b), the NICAM is the exclusive means by 
which any costs of an Interregional Transmission Project may be allocated between or among 
PJM, NYISO, and ISO-NE. 
(b) 
Nothing in the FERC-filed documents of ISO-NE, NYISO or PJM shall 
preclude agreement by entities with cost allocation rights under Section 205 of the Federal Power 
Act for their respective regions  (including the Long Island Power Authority and New York 
Power Authority in the NYISO region) to enter into separate agreements to allocate the cost of  
Interregional Transmission Projects proposed to be located in their regions as an alternative to 
the NICAM, or other transmission projects identified pursuant to assessments and studies 
conducted pursuant to Section 6 of the Northeastern Planning Protocol.  Such other cost-
allocation methodologies must be approved in each region pursuant to the Commission-approved 
rules in each region, filed with and accepted by the Commission, and shall apply only to the 
region's share of the costs of an Interregional Transmission Project or other transmission projects 
pursuant to Section 6 of the Northeastern Planning Protocol, as applicable.  
3. 
Filing Rights 
Nothing in this Schedule 15 will convey, expand, limit or otherwise alter any 
rights of ISO-NE, NYISO, PJM, each region’s transmission owners, market participants, or other 
entities to submit filings under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act regarding Interregional 
Cost Allocation or any other matter.   
Where applicable, the regions have been authorized by entities that have cost 
allocation rights for their respective regions to implement the provisions of this Schedule.  
4.  
Merchant Transmission and Individual Transmission Owner Projects  
Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the development of Interregional 
Transmission Projects that are funded solely by merchant transmission developers or by 
individual transmission owners. 
5.  
Consequences to Other Regions from Regional or Interregional `
 
Transmission Projects 
Except as provided in this Schedule 15 or where cost responsibility is expressly 
assumed by the ISO-NE region in other documents, agreements or tariffs on file with FERC, the 
ISO-NE region shall not be responsible for compensating another region for required upgrades or 
for any other consequences in another planning region associated with regional or interregional 
transmission facilities, including but not limited to, transmission projects identified pursuant to 
Section 6 of the Restated Northeastern Planning Coordination Protocol or Interregional 
Transmission Projects identified pursuant to Section 7 of the Restated Northeastern Planning 
Coordination Protocol.

SCHEDULE 16 
Blackstart Service 
 
Introduction and Description of Service 
Blackstart Service is necessary to facilitate a stable and orderly system restoration following a partial or 
complete shutdown of the New England Transmission System.  Resources are offered by Blackstart 
Owners to provide Blackstart Service and, if selected by the ISO, are modified (if required), maintained, 
tested and operated by a Market Participant, or its designee, in accordance with this Schedule 16.  The 
ISO shall select those resources whose locations and capabilities support the New England System 
Restoration Plan.  Following agreement between the owner and the ISO, such selected resources 
(“Designated Blackstart Resources”) shall provide and are eligible to receive compensation for providing 
Blackstart Service.  Blackstart Service is provided by Blackstart Owners via Designated Blackstart 
Resources, arranged for through the ISO, and utilized by Transmission Customers.  Transmission 
Customers are charged for Blackstart Service based on their pro-rata share of Monthly Regional Network 
Load. 
 
1. Eligibility Requirements: 
A resource must meet the eligibility requirements listed below, as detailed in ISO New England Operating 
Procedure No. 11 – Designated Blackstart Resource Administration (OP 11), to be considered for 
compensation as a Designated Blackstart Resource.

1.5. 
A Blackstart Service Commitment is established between the Blackstart Owner and the 
ISO. 
2. 
Term of Blackstart Service 
 
2.1. 
Term of Blackstart Service Commitment:  
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
The Designated Blackstart Resource’s term of Blackstart Service Commitment, as 
established under OP 11, shall start on the effective date of the resource’s Blackstart Service 
Commitment and, for a resource that: 
 
 
2.1.1. does not establish a Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment, the Blackstart 
Service Commitment shall continue until terminated in accordance with Section 2.3.  The 
Blackstart Owner and the ISO by mutual agreement may establish a minimum period for the open 
term, which shall not be greater than the number of years of the recovery period, as shown in 
Table 4a of Appendix A, that corresponds to the age of the Designated Blackstart Resource on the 
effective date of the Blackstart Service Commitment. 
 
 
2.1.2. establishes a Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment, the term of Blackstart 
Service Commitment shall equal the number of years of the recovery period, as shown in Table 
4a of Appendix A, that corresponds to the age of the Designated Blackstart Resource on the 
effective date of the Blackstart Service Commitment (i.e., the “specified term”).  The age of the 
resource shall be calculated based on the “In-Service Date”, as stated in the ISO’s “Forecast 
Report of Capacity, Energy, Loads, and Transmission (CELT Report).” 
At the expiration of the specified term of Blackstart Service Commitment and unless otherwise 
terminated in accordance with Section 2.3, a Designated Blackstart Resource will commence a 
new term of Blackstart Service Commitment in accordance with Section 2.1 and OP 11. 
2.2 
Termination: 
2.2.1. Mutual Termination:  The Blackstart Service Commitment may be terminated at 
any time by mutual agreement of the Blackstart Owner and ISO.  If the Blackstart Service 
Commitment is terminated under this provision, then the Designated Blackstart Resource’s 
Blackstart Standard Rate Payments or Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payments, as appropriate, 
will cease on the first day of the month following the day that the Blackstart Service Commitment 
is terminated and the Designated Blackstart Resource shall not recover any Lump Sum Blackstart 
Payments. 
2.2.2. Unilateral Termination: 
2.2.2.1. Either the Blackstart Owner or the ISO may terminate the Blackstart Service 
Commitment upon at least two (2) years’ written notice to the other party following the effective 
date of the Blackstart Service Commitment. In the event of a Force Majeure, the two-year written 
notice requirement shall be waived. 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
2.2.2.1.1. If the Blackstart Owner terminates the Blackstart Service Commitment under 
this provision, then the Designated Blackstart Resource’s Blackstart Standard Rate Payments or 
Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payments, as appropriate, will cease on the first day of the month 
following the day that the Blackstart Service Commitment is terminated and the Designated 
Blackstart Resource shall not recover any Lump Sum Blackstart Payments, except as provided for 
in Section 2.3.2.1.2. 
2.2.2.1.2. A Blackstart Owner may terminate the Blackstart Service Commitment of a 
Designated Blackstart Resource that establishes a Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment in 
order to retire the Designated Blackstart Resource if such retirement has been approved or 
required under the Tariff.  The payment of the Blackstart O&M Payment shall cease on the first 
day of the month following the day, as recognized by ISO, that the Designated Blackstart 
Resource stopped providing Blackstart Service. 
If the Blackstart Resource is retired in compliance with this Section, then it shall receive a single 
lump-sum payment in the month following the effective date of the retirement that equals the 
Lump Sum Blackstart Capital Payment as determined in Section 5.4. 
2.2.2.1.3. If the ISO terminates a Blackstart Service Commitment under this provision for 
reasons other than provided in Section 2.3.2.2, then: 
2.2.2.1.3.1. the Designated Blackstart Resource’s Blackstart O&M Payment will cease on 
the first day of the month following the day that the Blackstart Service Commitment is 
terminated; and 
2.2.2.1.3.2. the Blackstart Resource shall receive a single lump-sum payment in the 
month following the effective date of the termination that equals the Lump Sum Blackstart 
Capital Payment as determined in Section 5.4. 
2.2.2.2. Regardless of the term length, the ISO may terminate the Blackstart Service 
Commitment: 
2.2.2.2.1. with ninety (90) days’ notice to the Blackstart Owner following the issuance by 
the ISO to the Blackstart Owner of a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability notice.  The ISO 
shall not terminate the Blackstart Service Commitment if the Blackstart Owner corrects the 
failure within this ninety-day notice period; or 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
2.2.2.2.2. with ninety (90) days notice to the Blackstart Owner following the issuance by 
the ISO to the Blackstart Owner of a Failure to Perform During a System Restoration notice.  
The ISO shall not terminate the Blackstart Service Commitment if the Failure to Perform During 
a System Restoration was determined by the ISO to be due to an event of Force Majeure. 
2.2.2.2.3. If the ISO terminates the Blackstart Service Commitment under either Section 
2.2.2.2.1 or Section 2.2.2.2.2, then any remaining Designated Blackstart Resource Blackstart 
Standard Rate Payments or Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payments will cease on the first day 
of the month following the day that the Blackstart Service Commitment is terminated and the 
Designated Blackstart Resource shall not recover any Lump Sum Blackstart Payments. 
3. 
Rights and Obligations 
3.1. 
The Blackstart Owner shall follow ISO and Local Control Center operating dispatch 
instructions during the restoration of the New England Transmission System following a partial 
or complete shutdown of the New England Transmission System, in accordance with the 
Designated Blackstart Resource’s Blackstart Service obligations, as stated in this Section 3, and 
Blackstart Service Minimum Criteria. 
3.2. 
The Blackstart Owner shall not subject the Designated Blackstart Resource to any 
agreement, arrangement or procedure that conflicts with the resource’s ability to provide 
Blackstart Service, including any agreement, arrangement or procedure that would prevent the 
resource from following ISO or Local Control Center dispatch instructions during the restoration 
of the New England Transmission System following a partial or complete shutdown of the New 
England Transmission System. 
3.3. 
The Blackstart Owner shall maintain the ability of the Designated Blackstart Resource to 
perform in accordance with ISO New England Operating Documents.

information provided to the ISO and Local Control Centers. 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
3.6. 
A Blackstart Owner that desires to submit a request to retire or modify equipment that 
would diminish the ability of a Designated Blackstart Resource to provide Blackstart Service may 
submit the request if it simultaneously submits a notice of Blackstart Service Commitment 
termination to the ISO in accordance with Section 2.3.  The notice of Blackstart Service 
Commitment termination may be conditional on the ISO’s approval of the request to retire or 
modify. 
3.7. 
The terms and conditions of Schedule 16 shall apply to the Designated Blackstart 
Resource, whether or not it has a Capacity Supply Obligation, while the Designated Blackstart 
Resource is committed to provide Blackstart Service. 
3.8. 
The Blackstart Owner shall be entitled to take the Designated Blackstart Resource out of 
operation in accordance with the schedule for planned outages as established by the ISO, 
provided that the ISO has the right, working with the Blackstart Owner and the Local Control 
Center, to reposition the outage for reliability reasons with respect to Blackstart Service when 
establishing the planned outage schedule. 
3.9. 
The Blackstart Owner shall inform the ISO and Local Control Center of any planned 
outage of equipment under the Blackstart Owner’s control that affects the Designated Blackstart 
Resource’s ability to provide Blackstart Service.  
3.10. 
The Blackstart Owner shall maintain documentation of its procedures and training for 
starting the resource, energizing a de-energized bus and maintaining voltage and frequency 
during restoration, and provide this documentation to the ISO, upon request. 
4. 
Failure to Meet Blackstart Service Obligations 
4.1. 
A Blackstart Owner shall notify the ISO and Local Control Center as soon as practicable 
and within 15 minutes of identifying a failure or inability of a Designated Blackstart Resource to 
meet the Blackstart Service Minimum Criteria and Blackstart Service obligations specified in 
Schedule 16 and in the ISO New England Operating Documents pertaining to Blackstart Service.  
Such conditions include any forced outage of equipment under the Blackstart Owner’s control 
that affects the Designated Blackstart Resource’s ability to provide Blackstart Service, or that 
might constitute a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability or a Failure to Perform During a 
System Restoration. 
4.2. 
Upon receipt of the notice described in Section 4.1, the ISO shall assess all available 
information associated with a Designated Blackstart Resource’s inability to meet its Blackstart 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
Service Minimum Criteria and Blackstart Service obligations, and provide notice to the Blackstart 
Owner that a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability or a Failure to Perform During a System 
Restoration event has occurred (collectively or individually, a “Failure”) if the ISO determines 
based on that assessment that a Failure has occurred. 
4.3. 
The Blackstart Owner shall exercise diligence to correct the condition that caused the 
Failure promptly and provide notice to the ISO when the Failure has been corrected.  The ISO 
shall review and provide prompt acknowledgement of such notice.  If the Blackstart Owner 
determines that the Failure will continue for a period greater than 30 days from the date of the 
Failure, the Blackstart Owner shall submit a correction plan for approval by the ISO. 
4.4. 
Suspension of Payments as a result of a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability. 
 
4.4.1. If a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability has not been corrected within 30 days 
from date of the Failure, regardless of whether an ISO-approved correction plan is in place, then 
the ISO shall set the Designated Blackstart Resource’s Blackstart O&M Payment to zero effective 
on the date of the Failure. 
 
4.4.2. If a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability has not been corrected within 60 days 
from the date of the Failure or on a date established by the ISO based on a Blackstart Owner’s 
submitted correction plan (whichever is later), then the ISO shall set the Designated Blackstart 
Resource’s Total Blackstart Capital Payment to zero beginning on the day following the date that 
the correction was to be completed. 
4.5. 
Suspension of Payments as a result of a Failure to Perform During a System Restoration: 
Following a Failure to Perform During a System Restoration event, the ISO shall set the 
Designated Blackstart Resource’s Blackstart O&M Payment and Total Blackstart Capital 
Payment to zero effective on the date of the Failure to Perform During a System Restoration.  
The ISO shall not suspend a Designated Blackstart Resource’s Blackstart O&M Payment and 
Total Blackstart Capital Payment, if the Failure to Perform During a System Restoration was 
determined by the ISO to be due to an event of Force Majeure. 
 
4.6. 
Resumption of Suspended Payments:  Following the suspension of a Blackstart O&M 
Payment or Total Blackstart Capital Payment, the payment(s) shall resume upon the date, as 
recognized by the ISO, on which the Failure was corrected, provided, however, that the ISO 
retains its rights to terminate under the circumstances described in Section 2.3.2.2. 
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
4.7. 
Suspension of Payments or a Resumption of Suspended Payments:  A suspension of 
payments or a resumption of suspended payments under Section 4 shall result in a pro rata 
adjustment of the resource’s Blackstart Standard Rate Payments or Blackstart Station-specific 
Rate Payments, as appropriate, for the month(s) in which the suspension is applied or removed. 
5. 
Blackstart Service Payments 
A Blackstart Owner is eligible to receive payment for the provision of Blackstart Service from a 
Designated Blackstart Resource based on either the Blackstart Standard Rate Payment established in 
accordance with Section 5.1 or a Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payment established in accordance with 
Section 5.2.  Unless stated otherwise, a Designated Blackstart Resource’s Blackstart Standard Rate 
Payments or Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payments, as appropriate, shall start on the first day of the 
month following the effective day of the Blackstart Service Commitment, and shall cease on the first day 
of the month following the day that the Blackstart Service Commitment is terminated. 
 
5.1. 
Blackstart Standard Rate Payment 
 
 
5.1.1. General Provisions 
The Blackstart Standard Rate Payment utilizes the payment parameters contained within 
Appendix A to Schedule 16 – Blackstart Standard Rate Components and Capital Recovery 
Factors (“Appendix A”).  The ISO utilizes Appendix A, the ISO’s CELT Report and 
documentation provided by the Blackstart Owner to determine the Blackstart Standard Rate 
Payment that a Designated Blackstart Resource is to receive for Blackstart Service.   
 
5.1.1.1.  Designated Blackstart Resources that the ISO recognizes as requiring the 
addition of Blackstart Equipment to meet Blackstart Service Minimum Criteria may elect to 
establish the Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment for a single term determined in 
accordance with Section 2.1.2. 
 
5.1.1.2. Designated Blackstart Resources may establish one (and only one) of the 
following:  Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital Payment, an individual Additional 
Resource Standard Blackstart Capital Payment, a Station-level Specified-Term Blackstart Capital 
Payment or an individual Additional Resource Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment. 
5.1.1.3. The values in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 7 of Appendix A shall be adjusted on an annual 
basis in accordance with the most recent “Handy-Whitman Index of Public Utility Construction 
Costs” and then rounded to the nearest dollar.  The annual adjustment calculation shall become 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
effective on January 1 of the next year.  The ISO shall post on its website the updated Appendix 
A. 
The adjustment of the values in Table 1 and Table 7 shall be derived based on the Handy-
Whitman index values for the North Atlantic Region for July for “Common Labor” at Table B-1, 
line 19 (or its successor). 
The adjustment of the values in Table 2 and Table 3 shall be derived based on the Handy-
Whitman index values for the North Atlantic Region for July for “Total Other Production Plant” 
at Table E-1, line 28 (or its successor). 
5.1.2. A Designated Blackstart Resource at a Blackstart Station shall be entitled to 
Blackstart Service compensation in a month based on the following formula, Blackstart 
Owner-submitted data and values from Appendix A. 
Blackstart Standard Rate Payment individual = (Blackstart O&M Payment station + Total 
Blackstart Capital Payment station) / 12 * Designated Blackstart Resource individual nameplate 
MVA value / Σ Designated Blackstart  Resource individual nameplate MVA values at the 
Blackstart Station 
 
Where: 
Total Blackstart Capital Payment station = Standard Blackstart Capital Payment station + 
Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment station  
 
5.1.2.1. Blackstart O&M Payment station:  The Blackstart O&M Payment provides 
compensation to Blackstart Stations for the operating and maintenance expenses 
associated with the provision of Blackstart Service from Designated Blackstart Resources 
located at the Blackstart Station, and is derived based on the following formula using data 
from Tables 1 and 5 of Appendix A. 
Blackstart O&M Payment station = Station-level Blackstart O&M Payment + ΣAdditional 
Resource Blackstart O&M Payment for each additional Designated Blackstart Resource 
at the Blackstart Station. 
 
Where: 
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
The Station-level Blackstart O&M Payment is determined by selecting from Table 1 of 
Appendix A (based on the appropriate Designated Blackstart Resource type specified in 
Table 5 of Appendix A) the largest applicable Station-level Blackstart O&M Payment 
value for the Designated Blackstart Resource(s) located at the Blackstart Station; and 
 
The Additional Resource Blackstart O&M Payment is determined by selecting from 
Table 1 of Appendix A (based on the appropriate Designated Blackstart Resource type 
specified in Table 5 of Appendix A) the applicable payment values associated with each 
additional Designated Blackstart Resource(s) located at the Blackstart Station and 
excludes the Designated Blackstart Resource used to determine the Station-level 
Blackstart O&M Payment. 
5.1.2.2. Standard Blackstart Capital Payment station or Specified-Term Blackstart Capital 
Payment station:  The Standard Blackstart Capital Payment station or Specified-Term 
Blackstart Capital Payment station, but not both, provides compensation to Blackstart 
Stations for the capital cost associated with the provision of Blackstart Service from 
Designated Blackstart Resources located at the Blackstart Station.  
5.1.2.2.1.The Standard Blackstart Capital Payment station is derived based on the following 
formula using data from Tables 2 and 5 of Appendix A. 
Standard Blackstart Capital Payment station = Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital 
Payment + Σ Additional Resource Standard Blackstart Capital Payment for each 
additional Designated Blackstart Resource at the Blackstart Station that is eligible to 
establish such a payment. 
 
Where: 
The Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital Payment is determined by selecting from 
Table 2 of Appendix A (based on the appropriate Designated Blackstart Resource type 
specified in Table 5 of Appendix A) the largest applicable Station-level Standard 
Blackstart Capital Payment value for the Designated Blackstart Resource(s) located at the 
Blackstart Station that are eligible to receive a Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital 
Payment.  The Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital Payment shall be set to zero if 
any Designated Blackstart Resource located at the Blackstart Station is recovering a 
Station-level Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment. 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
The Additional Resource Standard Blackstart Capital Payment is determined by selecting 
from Table 2 of Appendix A (based on the appropriate Designated Blackstart Resource 
type specified in Table 5 of Appendix A) the applicable payment value associated with 
each additional Designated Blackstart Resource (s) located at the Blackstart Station that 
establishes an Additional Resource Standard Blackstart Capital Payment and excludes (i) 
the Designated Blackstart Resource located at the Blackstart Station that is used to 
establish the Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital Payment or Station-level 
Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment and (ii) the Designated Blackstart Resources 
located at the Blackstart Station that establish an Additional Resource Specified-Term 
Blackstart Capital Payment. 
5.1.2.2.2. The Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment station is derived based on the 
following formula using data from Tables 3, 4a and 5. 
Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment station = Station-level Specified-Term 
Blackstart Capital Cost * the appropriate capital recovery factor + Σ Additional Resource 
Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Cost * the appropriate capital recovery factor for each 
additional Designated Blackstart Resource at the Blackstart Station that is eligible to 
establish such a payment. 
 
Where: 
The Station-level Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment is determined by selecting, 
based on Tables 3 and 4a of Appendix A, the largest “Station-level Specified-Term 
Blackstart Capital Cost * the appropriate capital recovery factor” value for the 
Designated Blackstart Resource(s) located at the Blackstart Station that are eligible to 
receive a Station-level Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment. 
The Additional Resource Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment is determined by 
selecting, based on Tables 3 and 4a of Appendix A, the “Additional Resource Specified-
Term Blackstart Capital Cost* the appropriate capital recovery factor” associated with 
each additional Designated Blackstart Resource(s)located at the Blackstart Station that 
establishes an Additional Resource Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment and 
excludes (i) the Designated Blackstart Resource located at the Blackstart Station that is 
used to establish the Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital Payment or Station-level 
Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment and (ii) the Designated Blackstart Resources 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
located at the Blackstart Station that establish an Additional Resource Standard 
Blackstart Capital Payment. 
The capital recovery factor is based on Table 4a of Appendix A and reflects the age of 
the Designated Blackstart Resource that is recovering a Specified-Term Blackstart 
Capital Payment, where the age is determined by the resource’s “In-Service Date”, as 
stated in the CELT Report. 
5.2. 
Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payment 
The Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payment provides compensation to Blackstart Stations for 
the operation, maintenance and capital expenses associated with the provision of Blackstart 
Service from Designated Blackstart Resources located at the Blackstart Station, and is established 
by Commission acceptance of a Blackstart Owner’s filing, under Section 205 of the Federal 
Power Act, to establish or revise Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payment reflecting cost-based 
Blackstart Service compensation. 
 
5.2.1. The rate schedule shall specify two categories of Blackstart Service payments 
(Blackstart O&M Payment and Total Blackstart Capital Payment) of a Blackstart Station that are 
to be recovered annually for the provision of Blackstart Service. 
 
5.2.2. The Blackstart Owner is responsible for making all appropriate filings with the 
Commission and Blackstart Service compensation shall be governed solely by the Commission-
approved rate schedule. 
 
5.2.3. A Designated Blackstart Resource shall be entitled to compensation in a month 
based on the following formula: 
Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payment individual = (Blackstart O&M Payment station + 
Total Blackstart Capital Payment station) / 12 * Designated Blackstart Resource individual 
nameplate MVA value / Σ Designated Blackstart Resource individual nameplate MVA 
values at the Blackstart Station. 
 
Where: 
 
Blackstart O&M Payment station = the Commission-accepted annual Blackstart O&M 
Payment for the Blackstart Station, which shall include operations and maintenance 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
compensation for the provisions of Blackstart Service and for compliance with all 
associated NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards.  
 
Total Blackstart Capital Payment station = the Commission-accepted annual Blackstart 
Capital Payment for the Blackstart Station. 
 
 
5.3. 
Non-Designated Blackstart Resource Study Cost Payments 
If a Market Participant undertakes, at the direction of the ISO, a study to assess the viability of 
converting an offered resource to a Designated Blackstart Resource and the ISO issues a final 
determination not accepting a resource as a Designated Blackstart Resource, then the Market 
Participant(s) with Ownership Shares in the resource shall be reimbursed for either (i) the Non-
Designated Blackstart Resource Study Cost Payment in Table 7 to Appendix A or (ii) 
Commission-accepted compensation for study costs.  This payment provides compensation for 
study costs that were incurred after the date that the Blackstart Owner and ISO agreed that studies 
to determine the technical feasibility of the resource to provide Blackstart Service should be 
undertaken through the date of the final determination, including expenses incurred to fulfill 
information requests.  Such study cost compensation shall be made within a single monthly 
payment and charged to Transmission Customers based upon their pro-rata Monthly Regional 
Network Load share in the month in which the compensation is paid. 
5.4. 
Lump Sum Blackstart Payment 
A Lump Sum Blackstart Payment provides compensation for Designated Blackstart Resources 
that are retired or terminated under Section 2.3.2.1.2 or Section 2.3.2.1.3, respectively, and shall 
be paid to the retired or terminated Designated Blackstart Resource as a single lump-sum 
payment in the month following the effective date of the retirement or termination. A Lump Sum 
Blackstart Payment reflects the present value of the remaining Standard Blackstart Capital 
Payments due the eligible, retiring or terminated Designated Blackstart Resource(s). 
5.4.1. The Lump Sum Blackstart Payment individual is derived based on the following 
formula.   
 
Lump Sum Blackstart Payment individual = (Lump Sum Blackstart Capital Payment 
station) * Designated Blackstart Resource individual nameplate MVA value of the 
retiring or terminated Designated Blackstart Resource / Σ all the retiring or 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
terminated Designated Blackstart Resource individual nameplate MVA values at the 
Blackstart Station. 
 
5.4.1.1. For eligible retiring or terminated Designated Blackstart Resource(s) receiving 
Blackstart Standard Rate Payment under Section 5.1, the Lump Sum Blackstart Payment station is 
derived based on the following formula using data from Tables 2, 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 of Appendix A 
that is in effect on the retirement or termination date. 
5.4.1.1.1. At a Blackstart Station where (i) one of the Designated Blackstart Resources 
being retired or terminated establishes a Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital Payment, (ii) 
has a minimum period associated with its open-term Blackstart Service Commitment and (iii) the 
effective date of retirement or termination is within the minimum period, the Lump Sum 
Blackstart Capital Payment station shall equal the present value of the monthly Station-level 
Standard Blackstart Capital Payment, using data from Tables 2, 4a, 4b and 5, for the remaining 
months of the minimum period associated with the open-term Blackstart Service Commitment. 
5.4.1.1.2. At a Blackstart Station comprised of more than one Designated Blackstart 
Resource, where one of the Designated Blackstart Resources being retired or terminated 
establishes a Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Payment station, the Lump Sum Blackstart Capital 
Payment station shall equal the present value of the monthly Specified-Term Blackstart Capital 
Payment, using data from Tables 3, 4a, 4b and 5, for the remaining months of the term of 
Blackstart Service Commitment. 
5.4.1.1.3. The Lump Sum Blackstart Capital Payment station that is calculated pursuant to 
Section 5.4.1.1.1 or Section 5.4.1.1.2 shall be adjusted by: (a) adding, if any and as applicable, for 
any other Designated Blackstart Resources are being retired or terminated and that have a 
minimum period associated with the open-term Blackstart Service Commitment, the present value 
of the Additional Resource Standard Blackstart Capital Payment(s), using data from Tables 2, 4a, 
4b and 5, for the remaining months of the applicable minimum period of Blackstart Service 
Commitment; (b) adding, if any and as applicable, for any other Designated Blackstart Resources 
are being retired or terminated and that have a specified-term associated with their Blackstart 
Service Commitment, the present value of the Additional Resource Specified-Term Blackstart 
Capital Cost(s), using data from Tables 3, 4a, 4b and 5, for the remaining months of the 
applicable specified-term Blackstart Service Commitment; (c) subtracting, if any and as 
applicable, for any Designated Blackstart Resources are continuing in service and that have a 
minimum periods associated with their open-term Blackstart Service Commitments, the present 
Effective Date: 1/1/2019 - Docket # ER19-251-000 
 
value of the new Station-level Standard Blackstart Capital Payment, using data from Tables 2, 4a, 
4b and 5, for the remaining months of the applicable minimum period; and (d) subtracting, if any 
and as applicable, for any Designated Blackstart Resources are continuing in service and that 
have a specified-term Blackstart Service Commitment, the present value of the new Station-level 
Specified-Term Blackstart Capital Cost, using data from Tables 3, 4a, 4b and 5, for the remaining 
months of the applicable specified-term of Blackstart Service Commitment.     
5.4.1.2. For eligible, retiring or terminated Designated Blackstart Resource(s) receiving 
Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payment under Section 5.2, the Lump Sum Blackstart Payment 
individual, Lump Sum Blackstart Capital and Payment station is derived in accordance with the Lump 
Sum Blackstart Payment provisions included in the applicable Blackstart Owner’s Section 205 
Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payment filing, as approved by FERC.   
5.5. 
Equipment Damage Reimbursement 
 
Blackstart Owners are eligible for Equipment Damage Reimbursement under Schedule 16 for 
equipment damage to a Designated Blackstart Resource: (1) that resulted from operating such 
equipment in response to operating dispatch instructions from the ISO during the restoration of 
the New England Transmission System, (2) for which reasonably available and customary 
insurance was sought and not available for the damages incurred and (3) that would not have 
occurred but for the Blackstart Owner’s provision of Blackstart Service from that Designated 
Blackstart Resource.  The burden of making such showings will be upon the Blackstart Owners 
and it is the responsibility of the Blackstart Owners to seek Commission approval under Section 
205 of the Federal Power Act for any reimbursement under this Section.  Equipment Damage 
Reimbursement individual shall equal the Commission-approved Equipment Damage 
Reimbursement for a Designated Blackstart Resource. 
5.6. 
Total Blackstart Service Payments 
The Total Blackstart Service Payments in a month shall be based on the following formula: 
 
Total Blackstart Service Payments month = Σ Blackstart Standard Rate Payment individual + Σ  
 
Blackstart Station-specific Rate Payment individual + Σ Non-Designated Blackstart Resource  
 
Study Cost Payments for the month + Σ Lump Sum Blackstart Payments individual + Σ  
 
Equipment Damage Reimbursement individual.

SCHEDULE 17  
RECOVERY OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION COSTS  
BY FACILITIES CRITICAL TO THE DERIVATION OF INTERCONNECTION RELIABILITY 
OPERATING LIMITS  
 
Introduction 
NERC Reliability Standard CIP-002-5.1a – Cyber Security – BES Cyber System Categorization (“CIP-
002-5.1”) requires the identification, assessment and categorization of facilities that NERC defines as 
Bulk Electric System (“BES”) Cyber Systems and associated BES Cyber Assets for the application of 
cyber security requirements commensurate with the adverse impact that their loss, compromise, or misuse 
could have on the reliable operation of the BES.  Criterion 2.6 in Attachment 1 – Impact Rating Criteria 
to CIP-002-5.1 assigns a medium impact rating to generation and transmission facilities that the ISO 
identifies as critical to the derivation of Interconnection Reliability Operating Limits and their associated 
contingencies (“IROL-Critical Facilities”).  In accordance with CIP-002-5.1, an owner of an IROL-
Critical Facility (“IROL-Critical Facility Owner”) must comply with the controls included in the NERC 
CIP Reliability Standards corresponding to the medium impact category.   
This Schedule 17 provides for the recovery of an IROL-Critical Facility Owner’s incremental capital, 
operation and maintenance, and associated administrative and regulatory costs paid to comply with the 
NERC CIP Reliability Standards corresponding to the medium impact category (collectively, “IROL-CIP 
Costs”), as approved by the Commission’s acceptance of the IROL-Critical Facility Owner’s filing 
pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act, at one or more IROL-Critical Facilities to the extent 
cost recovery for the IROL-CIP Costs is not provided for under another provision of the Tariff or a 
contractual arrangement to which the IROL-Critical Facility Owner is a party.  Eligible IROL-CIP Costs 
are above and beyond the costs paid by the IROL-Critical Facility Owner to comply with NERC CIP 
Reliability Standards corresponding to low impact requirements.  Nothing in this Schedule 17 shall 
restrict or limit the rights of an IROL-Critical Facility Owner to make a filing with the Commission 
 
 
 
 
Effective Date: 3/6/2020 - Docket #: ER20-739-001 
 
pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act to recover IROL-CIP Costs through a means other than 
this Schedule 17. 
Under this Schedule 17, the ISO will act as the billing and collection agent on behalf of the IROL-Critical 
Facility Owners for recovery of their Commission-approved IROL-CIP Costs.  The ISO will allocate to, 
invoice, and collect from Transmission Customers that receive Regional Network Service and/or Through 
or Out Service IROL-CIP Costs approved by the Commission and, upon collection of such costs, will pay 
equivalent amounts to the pertinent IROL-Critical Facility Owner(s), in the manner specified in this 
Schedule 17. 
 
1. 
IROL-Critical Facility Designation and Notification 
The ISO shall designate a generation facility or transmission facility as an IROL-Critical Facility in 
accordance with applicable NERC Reliability Standards.  When the ISO identifies a generator or 
transmission facility as IROL-Critical, the ISO shall provide written notification of the designation to the 
IROL-Critical Facility Owner or its Lead Market Participant, as applicable.  The notice shall specify: (a) 
the facility by name and asset identification if applicable, and (b) the effective date for the IROL-Critical 
Facility designation. 
The ISO reviews IROL-Critical Facility designations annually or more frequently based on New England 
Transmission System changes.  If, based on this review, the ISO determines that an IROL-Critical 
Facility no longer meets applicable NERC criteria for designation as an IROL-Critical Facility, the ISO 
shall provide written notice to the IROL-Critical Facility Owner or its Lead Market Participant, as 
applicable, of the effective date of such termination.   
 
2. 
Requirements for Recovery of IROL-CIP Costs 
 
2.1 
Pre-Filing Obligations of an IROL-Critical Facility Owner  
 
 
 
 
Effective Date: 3/6/2020 - Docket #: ER20-739-001 
 
To recover IROL-CIP Costs under this Schedule 17, in accordance with Section 2.2 below, an IROL-
Critical Facility Owner must submit a filing to the Commission pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal 
Power Act requesting approval of IROL-CIP Costs proposed to be recovered.  An IROL-Critical Facility 
Owner that intends to make a Section 205 filing for the recovery of IROL-CIP Costs pursuant to this 
Schedule 17 shall comply with the following pre-filing requirements:  
(A)  Prior to submitting a Section 205 filing for recovery of IROL-CIP Costs, the IROL-Critical 
Facility Owner shall provide to the ISO a summary description of the proposed filing, including the 
incremental medium impact IROL-CIP Costs and the supporting data, calculations, and workpapers for 
those costs, with any confidential or proprietary information redacted, and contact information for the 
IROL-Critical Facility Owner.  The ISO shall post on its website all materials provided to the ISO by the 
IROL-Critical Facility Owner.  To receive automated notification of the ISO’s postings of the materials 
provided by the IROL-Critical Facility Owner, entities may self-subscribe to the ISO’s Schedule 17 
distribution list.  Any entity that wishes to participate as an interested party (“Interested Party”) in the 
pre-filing review process described in Sections 2.1(B) and (C) below shall contact the IROL-Critical 
Facility Owner to request Interested Party status by no later than the tenth day following the interactive 
session described in Section 2.1(B) below.

3. 
Invoicing and Collection of IROL-CIP Costs by ISO 
The ISO acts as the billing and collection agent on behalf of the IROL-Critical Facility Owner for 
recovery of IROL-CIP Costs approved by the Commission’s acceptance of the IROL-Critical Facility 
Owner’s filing pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  Upon notification from the IROL-
Critical Facility Owner that a Commission Order approving IROL-CIP Costs for recovery under this 
Schedule 17 has been issued, the ISO shall initiate payment of such costs to the IROL-Critical Facility 
Owners, and allocation and invoicing of such costs to Transmission Customers in the manner set forth in 
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 below.   
3.1 
Monthly Payment to IROL-Critical Facility Owner  
The ISO shall remit Commission-approved IROL-CIP Costs collected by the ISO in monthly payments of 
equal amounts over twelve (12) consecutive months to the applicable Market Participants based on their 
respective ownership shares in an associated IROL-Critical Facility.  The ISO shall commence monthly 
payment of IROL-CIP Costs in the Monthly Statement issued for the first month immediately following 
the ISO’s receipt of the IROL-Critical Facility Owner’s notification of the Commission Order approving

SCHEDULE 18 - MTF; MTF SERVICE 
 
This Schedule 18 contains the main substantive provisions regarding the treatment of MTF and MTF 
Service under the OATT.  
 
1.  
Definitions  
Capitalized terms used and defined in this Schedule 18 shall have the meaning given them under this 
Schedule.  Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Schedule 18 but defined in other provisions of 
the Tariff shall have the meaning given them under those provisions. Capitalized terms used in this 
Schedule 18 that are not defined in it or elsewhere in the Tariff shall have the meanings customarily 
attributed to such terms by the electric utility industry in New England.  
 
1.1  
MTF: The Cross Sound Cable high voltage, direct current Merchant Transmission Facilities of 
+/- 150 kV and associated dc/ac converter facilities that are directly interconnected with the 345 kV PTF 
in Connecticut at the East Shore substation, and the 138kV transmission facilities at the Shoreham 
substation on Long Island, New York that were subject to the Commission order in TransEnergie U.S., 
Ltd., 91 FERC 61,230 (2000) (Docket No. ER00-1-000).  
 
1.2  
MTF Provider: The owner of MTF, or its Designated Agent, that offers transmission service 
over the MTF to Eligible Customers through the MTF Transmission Provider Page on the OASIS.  
 
1.3  
MTF Service: Point-To-Point Transmission Service over MTF.  
 
1.4 
 MTF Service Charge: The charge applicable to MTF Service, which shall be determined 
pursuant to arrangements between the MTF Provider and Eligible Customers that take MTF Service under 
this Schedule 18. The charge applicable to MTF Service shall be in accordance with the Commission’s 
authorization for the MTF Provider to charge negotiated rates (i.e., rates established pursuant to market 
mechanisms as recognized for merchant transmission projects and not included in other OATT rates) for 
the use of transmission service over its MTF.  
 
1.5  
MTF Transmission Provider Page: The transmission provider page for the MTF located on the 
OASIS. Transmission Service over the MTF to Eligible Customers will be offered through the MTF 
Transmission Provider Page. Some of the information posted on the MTF Transmission Provider Page 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
shall include: values for Available Transfer Capability (ATC); offerings for MTF Service (including 
Firm, Non-Firm and secondary transmission rights); the parameters and results of the Commission-
mandated open-season process used to initially allocate transmission rights; a description of the 
Commission-approved rights allocation process; and procedures for the application for and acquisition of 
MTF Service.  
 
2.  
Allocation of Available Transfer Capability Over MTF  
 
2.1  
Commission-Approved Allocation Process: All available transfer capability over MTF shall be 
allocated to the owner of the MTF who may assign it under a Commission-approved rights allocation 
process. The MTF Provider shall post the results of the Commission-approved rights allocation process 
on the MTF Transmission Provider Page. To the extent that transfer capability over MTF is not fully 
reserved through the Commission-approved rights allocation process, such excess transfer capability shall 
be available in accordance with this Schedule 18. In the event that the entire capability of the MTF is 
reserved under the Commission-approved rights allocation process, secondary rights to use the MTF, to 
the extent unused by the primary rights holders, shall be offered on the MTF Transmission Provider Page 
on the OASIS by MTF Providers in accordance with a Commission-approved process for offering such 
rights.  
 
3.  
MTF Service  
 
3.1  
Nature of MTF Service  
 
(a)  
Term of MTF Service:  
 
(i)  
Firm MTF Service: The minimum term of Firm MTF Service shall be one day and the 
maximum term shall be that specified in the MTF Transmission Service Agreement.  
 
(ii)  
Non-firm MTF Service: Non-Firm MTF Service will be available for periods ranging 
from one hour to one month and shall be that specified in the MTF Transmission Service 
Agreement. However, a Transmission Customer who purchases Non-Firm MTF Service 
will be entitled to reserve a sequential term of service (such as a sequential monthly term 
without having to wait for the initial term to expire before requesting another monthly 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
term) so that the total time period for which the reservation applies may be greater than 
one month, subject to the requirements of this Schedule 18.  
 
(b)  
Reservation, Interruption, and Curtailment Priority for MTF Service:  
 
(i)  
The MTF Provider shall post on the MTF Transmission Provider Page, rules setting 
reservation, interruption and Curtailment priorities for Firm and Non-Firm MTF Service. 
Such rules shall be non-discriminatory and consistent with the Commission’s approval of 
the rights to charge negotiated rates (i.e., rates established pursuant to market 
mechanisms as recognized for merchant transmission projects and not included in other 
OATT rates).  
 
(ii)  
If an MTF Provider fails to post such rules, then reservation, interruption and Curtailment 
priorities for Firm and Non-Firm MTF Service shall be the same as those established 
under the OATT for transmission service over the PTF.  
 
(iii)  
MTF reservation priorities shall be established separately from OTF or PTF reservation 
priorities.  
 
(iv)  
Firm MTF Service: The MTF reservation priority for either Long-Term Firm MTF 
Service or Short-Term Firm MTF Service (which are based upon an award of rights to 
transmission service over the MTF pursuant to a Commission-approved rights allocation 
process) shall be determined by the date of the issuance of such award.  
 
(v)  
Non-Firm MTF Service: Non-Firm MTF Service shall be available from transfer 
capability in excess of that needed for reliable service to Long-Term and Short-Term 
Firm MTF Service. A higher reservation priority will be assigned to Non-Firm MTF 
Service reservations with a longer duration of service than those reservations with a 
shorter duration. Competing requests of equal duration for Non-Firm MTF Service will 
be prioritized based on the highest price offered by the Eligible Customer for the 
transmission service, or in the event the price for all Eligible Customers is the same, will 
be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis (i.e., in the chronological sequence in 
which each Transmission Customer has reserved service). Eligible Customers that have 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
already reserved shorter-term service over MTF have the right of first refusal to match 
any longer-term request before being preempted, provided that such Eligible Customer’s 
advance reservation is consistent with any modified request for Non-Firm MTF Service.  
 
(c)  
Use of MTF Service By a Transmission Customer: If a Transmission Customer elects 
to take MTF Service, it may reserve transmission service to facilitate both the delivery of 
energy and/or capacity to it over the MTF (to the extent permitted under the 
Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff) commensurate with the associated MTF 
transmission reservation designated by it in Completed Applications and the delivery of 
Energy and/or capacity to or from it over the MTF to the extent permitted under the 
Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff. In order to fulfill its obligations to serve load 
or to consummate a transaction, a Transmission Customer that takes MTF Service under 
this Schedule 18 must also take service under Schedule 8 or 9 of this OATT for use of the 
PTF and under Schedule 21 of this OATT for use of the Non-PTF, as applicable. Any 
load-serving entity may use MTF Service to effect transactions in bilateral arrangements.  
 
(d)  
MTF Transmission Service Agreements: A standard form MTF Transmission Service 
Agreement (Attachment A) will be offered to an Eligible Customer when it submits a 
Completed Application for Long-Term Firm, Short-Term Firm or Non-Firm MTF 
Service pursuant to this Schedule 18. Executed MTF Transmission Service Agreements 
that contain the information required under this Schedule 18 will be filed with the 
Commission in compliance with applicable Commission regulations.  
 
(e)  
Classification of MTF Service:  
 
(i)  
Transmission Customers requesting MTF Service for the transmission of capacity and 
energy do so with the full realization that such service is subject to availability and 
Curtailment pursuant to Section II.44 of this OATT and that the ISO will redispatch all 
Resources subject to its control, pursuant to the Transmission, Markets and Services 
Tariff, in order to meet load and to accommodate External Transactions. Transmission 
Customers will be charged for the Congestion Costs and any other costs associated with 
such redispatch in accordance with the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
(ii)  
Each Point of Receipt at which firm transmission capacity is reserved for Long-Term 
Firm MTF Service by the Transmission Customer shall be set forth in the MTF 
Transmission Service Agreement for such Service along with a corresponding capacity 
reservation over the MTF associated with each Point of Receipt.  
 
(iii)  
Points of Receipt and corresponding capacity reservations shall be as mutually agreed 
upon by the MTF Provider and the Transmission Customer for Short-Term Firm MTF 
Service. Each Point of Delivery at which firm transmission capacity is reserved for Short-
Term Firm MTF Service by the Transmission Customer shall be set forth in the MTF 
Transmission Service Agreement for such Service along with a corresponding capacity 
reservation associated with each Point of Delivery. Points of Delivery and corresponding 
capacity reservations shall be as mutually agreed upon by the MTF Provider and the 
Transmission Customer for Short-Term Firm MTF Service.  
 
(iv)  
Non-Firm MTF Service shall be offered under applicable terms and conditions contained 
in this Schedule 18. Non-Firm MTF Service shall include transmission of energy on an 
hourly basis and transmission of scheduled short-term capacity and energy on a daily, 
weekly or monthly basis, but not to exceed one month’s reservation for any one 
Application.  
 
(v)  
The greater of either (1) the sum of the capacity reservations at the Point(s) of Receipt, or 
(2) the sum of the capacity reservations at the Point(s) of Delivery shall be the 
Transmission Customer’s Reserved Capacity over the MTF. The Customer’s use may not 
exceed its capacity reserved over the MTF at each Point of Receipt and each Point of 
Delivery except as otherwise specified in this Schedule 18.  
 
(f)  
Scheduling Associated with MTF Service: Market External Transactions submitted 
into the Real-time Market and associated with MTF Service shall be dispatched pursuant 
to the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff. Transmission Customers will be 
charged for the Congestion Costs and any other costs associated with such dispatch in 
accordance with the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
(g)  
Curtailment Associated with MTF Service: When the ISO determines that an electrical 
emergency exists on the New England Transmission System and implements emergency 
procedures to effect a Curtailment of MTF Service, the Transmission Customer shall 
make the required reductions upon the ISO’s request. The ISO reserves the right to effect 
a Curtailment, as necessary, in whole or in part, of any MTF Service provided under this 
Schedule 18 when, in the ISO’s sole discretion, an emergency or other unforeseen 
condition impairs or degrades the reliability of the New England Transmission System. 
The ISO will notify all affected Transmission Customers in a timely manner of any 
Curtailments. The ISO will redispatch all Resources subject to its control, pursuant to this 
Tariff, in order to meet load and to accommodate External Transactions. To the extent not 
otherwise provided for in this Section, External Transactions using MTF Service shall be 
Curtailed or interrupted in accordance with Section II.44 of this OATT. Transmission 
Customers will be charged for the Congestion Costs and any other costs associated with 
such redispatch in accordance with the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff. 
Pursuant to such redispatch, in the event that the ISO exercises its right to effect a 
Curtailment, in whole or part, of Firm MTF Service, no credit or other adjustment shall 
be provided as a result of the Curtailment with respect to the charge payable by the 
Transmission Customer, unless provided for by the MTF Provider under arrangements 
between the MTF Provider and the Transmission Customer.  
 
3.2  
Availability of MTF Service: To the extent that transfer capability over MTF has not been fully 
allocated in accordance with Section 2 of this Schedule 18, a Transmission Customer that is an Eligible 
Customer (except as provided below) may reserve Firm or Non-Firm MTF Service. Such service shall be 
provided and administered by the MTF Provider(s) and shall be reserved pursuant to the applicable terms 
and conditions of this Schedule 18. MTF Service shall be reserved through the MTF Provider pursuant to 
this Schedule 18. Service on the MTF requires advance reservations.  
 
MTF Service is available to any Eligible Customer unless an MTF Provider has informed the ISO that 
MTF Service shall not be made available to such Eligible Customer due to that Customer’s failure to 
make necessary payments for previously assessed MTF Service Charges or failure to meet the 
creditworthiness or operational requirements posted by the MTF Provider on the MTF Transmission 
Provider Page on the OASIS.  
 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
3.3  
Reservation of MTF Service: An Eligible Customer requesting Firm or Non-Firm MTF Service 
shall comply with the applicable provisions of this Schedule 18.  
 
4.

Transmission Customer’s request for service; and  
 
• 
The electrical location of the ultimate load.  
 
The MTF Provider will treat this information in (vi.) as confidential at the request of the Transmission 
Customer except to the extent that disclosure of this information is required by the MTO pursuant to this 
Schedule 18, by regulatory or judicial order, or for reliability purposes pursuant to Good Utility Practice. 
The MTF Provider shall treat this information consistent with the standards of conduct contained in Part 
37 of the Commission’s regulations.  
 
5.4  
Deposit:  
If required by the MTF Provider, a Completed Application for MTF Service by a 
Transmission Customer shall also include a deposit of no more than (a) one (1) month’s charge for 
Reserved Capacity over the MTF for service requests of one (1) month or greater or (b) the full charge for 
Reserved Capacity over the MTF for service requests of less than one (1) month. If the Application for 
MTF Service is rejected by the MTF Provider because it does not meet the conditions for service as set 
forth herein, or in the case of requests for service arising in connection with losing bidders in a request for 
proposals (RFP), the deposit will be returned with Interest, less any reasonable administrative costs 
incurred by the MTF Provider, the ISO or any affected Transmission Owners in connection with the 
review of the Application for MTF Service. The deposit also will be returned with Interest, less any 
reasonable administrative costs incurred by the MTF Provider, the ISO or any affected Transmission 
Owners if the new facilities or upgrades needed to provide the service cannot be completed. If an 
Application for MTF Service is withdrawn or the Eligible Customer decides not to enter into a MTF 
Transmission Service Agreement, the deposit will be refunded in full, with Interest, less reasonable 
administrative costs incurred by the MTF Provider, the ISO or any affected Transmission Owners to the 
extent such costs have not already been recovered from the Eligible Customer. The MTF Provider will 
provide to the Eligible Customer a complete accounting of all costs deducted from the refunded deposit, 
which the Eligible Customer may contest if there is a dispute concerning the deducted costs. Deposits 
associated with construction of new facilities or upgrades are subject to the provisions of this OATT. If a 
MTF Transmission Service Agreement for MTF Service is executed, the deposit, with Interest, will be 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
returned to the Transmission Customer upon expiration or termination of the MTF Transmission Service 
Agreement. Applicable Interest will be calculated from the day the deposit is credited to the MTF 
Provider’s account.  
 
5.5  
Notice of Deficient Application: If an Application for MTF Service fails to meet the 
requirements of this Schedule 18, the MTF Provider will notify the entity requesting service within fifteen 
(15) days of the MTF Provider’s receipt of the Application for MTF Service of the reasons for such 
failure. The MTF Provider will attempt to remedy minor deficiencies in the Application for MTF Service 
through informal communications with the Eligible Customer. If such efforts are unsuccessful, the MTF 
Provider will return the Application for MTF Service, along with any deposit (less the reasonable 
administrative costs incurred by the MTF Provider, the ISO or any affected Transmission Owners in 
connection with the Application for MTF Service), with Interest. Upon receipt of a new or revised 
Application for MTF Service that fully complies with the requirements of this Schedule 18, the Eligible 
Customer will be assigned a new reservation priority based upon the date of receipt by the MTF Provider 
of the new or revised Application for MTF Service.  
 
5.6  
Response to a Completed Application: Following receipt of a Completed Application the 
Eligible Customer will be notified as soon as practicable, but not later than thirty (30) days after the date 
of receipt of a Completed Application for MTF Service. Responses by the MTF Provider must be made as 
soon as practicable to all Completed Applications for MTF Service and the timing of such responses must 
be made on a nondiscriminatory basis.  
 
5.7  
Execution of MTF Transmission Service Agreement: Whenever the MTF Provider determines 
that a System Impact Study is not required and that the requested service can be provided, it will notify 
the Eligible Customer as soon as practicable but no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the 
Completed Application for MTF Service, and will tender a MTF Transmission Service Agreement to the 
Eligible Customer. Failure of an Eligible Customer to execute and return the MTF Transmission Service 
Agreement or request the filing of an unexecuted MTF Transmission Service Agreement, within fifteen 
(15) days after it is tendered by the MTF Provider shall be deemed a withdrawal and termination of the 
Application for MTF Service and any deposit (less the reasonable administrative costs incurred by the 
MTF Provider, the ISO and any affected Transmission Owners in connection with the Application for 
MTF Service) submitted will be refunded with Interest. Nothing herein limits the right of an Eligible 
Customer to file another Application for MTF Service after such withdrawal and termination. Where a 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
System Impact Study is required, the provisions of this Schedule 18 will govern the execution of a MTF 
Transmission Service Agreement.  
 
(a)  
Extensions for Commencement of Firm MTF Service: The Transmission Customer 
can obtain, subject to availability, up to five one-year extensions for the commencement of 
service. The Transmission Customer may postpone service by paying a non-refundable annual 
reservation fee equal to one-month’s charge for Firm MTF Service for each year or fraction 
thereof within 15 days of notifying the MTF Provider that it intends to extend the commencement 
of service. If during any extension for the commencement of service an Eligible Customer 
submits a Completed Application for Firm MTF Service, and such request can be satisfied only 
by releasing all or part of the Transmission Customer’s Reserved Capacity over the MTF, the 
original Reserved Capacity over the MTF will be released unless the following condition is 
satisfied: within thirty (30) days, the original Transmission Customer agrees to pay the applicable 
rate for Firm MTF Service for its Reserved Capacity over the MTF for the period that its 
reservation overlaps the period covered by such Eligible Customer’s Completed Application for 
MTF Service. In the event the Transmission Customer elects to release the Reserved Capacity 
over the MTF, the reservation fees or portions thereof previously paid will be forfeited.  
 
5.8  
Confidentiality of Information and Standards of Conduct. The MTF Provider will treat all 
information included in the Application as confidential in accordance with the MTF Provider’s 
information policy except to the extent that disclosure of such information is required by this Schedule 
18, by regulatory or judicial order, or for reliability purposes pursuant to Good Utility Practice. The MTF 
Provider will treat this information consistent with the standards of conduct contained in 18 C.F.R. Part 
37 of the Commission’s regulations.  
 
6.  
Determination of Available Transfer Capability  
 
Following approval of a tendered application for MTF Service, the MTF Provider will make a 
determination on a non-discriminatory basis of Available Transfer Capability pursuant to this Schedule 18 
and Attachment C to this OATT. Such determination shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable 
after receipt, but not later than the following time periods for the following terms of service (i) thirty-five 
(35) minutes for hourly service, (ii) thirty-five (35) minutes for daily service, (iii) four (4) hours for 
weekly service, and (iv) two (2) days for monthly service.  
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
 
7.  
Payment for MTF Service  
A Transmission Customer shall pay the MTF Service Charge to the MTF Provider, or its designated 
agent, if the Customer: (i) receives Firm or Non-Firm MTF Service based upon an allocation of rights to 
transmission service over the MTF awarded to the Transmission Customer through a Commission-
approved rights allocation process; (ii) reserves on the MTF Transmission Provider Page transfer 
capability over the MTF not initially allocated in the Commission-approved rights allocation process; or 
(iii) reserves on the MTF Transmission Provider Page transfer capability over the MTF made available as 
a result of an assignment by a rights holder of MTF transfer capability, a default release pursuant to rules 
filed with the Commission and business practices or a capability forfeiture by a rights holder for non-use 
consistent with the terms of a Commission-approved rights allocation. The Transmission Customer will 
be billed for its Reserved Capacity over the MTF under the terms of this Schedule 18 for MTF.  
 
8.  
Changes in Service Specifications of MTF Service  
 
8.1  
Modification on a Firm Basis: Any request by a Transmission Customer to modify Point(s) of 
Receipt and Point(s) of Delivery on a firm basis shall be treated as a new request for MTF Service in 
accordance with this Schedule 18, except that such Transmission Customer shall not be obligated to pay 
any additional deposit if the capacity reservation over the MTF does not exceed the amount reserved in 
the existing MTF Transmission Service Agreement. While such new request is pending, the Transmission 
Customer shall retain its reservation priority for service at the firm Point(s) of Receipt and Point(s) of 
Delivery specified in the Transmission Customer’s MTF Transmission Service Agreement.  
 
8.2  
Modifications on a Non-Firm Basis: The Transmission Customer taking Firm MTF Service 
may submit a request to the MTF Provider for transmission service on a non-firm basis over Point(s) of 
Receipt and Point(s) of Delivery other than those specified in the MTF Transmission Service Agreement 
(“Secondary Receipt and Delivery Points”), in amounts not to exceed the Transmission Customer’s firm 
capacity reservation over the MTF, without incurring an additional Non-Firm MTF Service charge or 
executing a new MTF Transmission Service Agreement, subject to the following conditions:  
 
(a)  
service provided over Secondary Receipt and Delivery Points will be non-firm only, on 
an as-available basis, and will not displace any firm or non-firm service reserved or 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
scheduled by Transmission Customers under this OATT or by the Transmission 
Customers on behalf of their Native Load Customers or Excepted Transactions;  
 
(b) 
 the Transmission Customer shall retain its right to schedule Firm MTF Service at the 
Point(s) of Receipt and Point(s) of Delivery specified in the relevant MTF Transmission 
Service Agreement in the amount of the Transmission Customer’s original capacity 
reservation over the MTF; and 
 
(c)  
service over Secondary Receipt and Delivery Points on a non-firm basis shall not require 
the filing of an Application for Non-Firm MTF Service under the OATT. However, all 
other requirements of this OATT (except as to transmission rates) shall apply to 
transmission service on a non-firm basis over Secondary Receipt and Delivery Points.  
 
9.  
Sale, Assignment or Transfer of MTF Service  
 
9.1  
Procedures for Sale, Assignment or Transfer of Service: Pursuant to Commission-approved 
rules posted by the MTF Provider on the MTF Transmission Provider Pages on the OASIS, a 
Transmission Customer may sell, assign, or transfer all or a portion of its rights under its MTF 
Transmission Service Agreement, but only to another Eligible Customer (the “Assignee”). The 
Transmission Customer that sells, assigns or transfers its rights under its MTF Transmission Service 
Agreement is hereafter referred to as the “Reseller.”  Compensation to the Reseller shall be at rates 
established by the Reseller and posted on the MTF Transmission Provider Page. The Assignee must 
execute a service agreement with the MTF Provider governing reassignments of transmission service 
prior to the date on which the reassigned service. If the Assignee does not request any change in the 
Point(s) of Receipt or the Point(s) of Delivery, or a change in any other term or condition set forth in the 
original MTF Transmission Service Agreement, the Assignee shall receive the same services as did the 
Reseller and the transmission priority of service for the Assignee shall be the same as that of the Reseller. 
A Reseller shall notify the MTF Provider as soon as possible after any sale, assignment or transfer of 
service occurs, but in any event, notification must be provided prior to any provision of service to the 
Assignee. The Assignee shall be subject to all terms and conditions of this Schedule 18. If the Assignee 
requests a change in service, the reservation priority of service will be determined by the MTF Provider 
pursuant to this Schedule 18.  
 
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
9.2  
Limitations on and Obligations of Assignment or Transfer of Service: If the Assignee 
requests a change in the Point(s) of Receipt or Point(s) of Delivery, or a change in any other 
specifications set forth in the original MTF Transmission Service Agreement, the MTF Provider will 
consent to such change subject to the provisions of this Schedule 18, provided that the change will not 
impair the operation and reliability of the Market Participants’ generation systems or TO’s transmission 
or distribution systems. The Assignee shall compensate the MTF Provider, the ISO and any affected 
Transmission Owner for performing any System Impact Study needed to evaluate the capability of the 
MTF to accommodate the proposed change and any additional costs resulting from such change. The 
Reseller shall remain liable for the performance of all obligations under the MTF Transmission Service 
Agreement, except as specifically agreed to by the MTF Provider, the Reseller and the Assignee through 
an amendment to the MTF Transmission Service Agreement.  
 
9.3 Information on Assignment or Transfer of Service: All re-sales or assignments of capacity must be 
conducted through or otherwise posted on the MTF Transmission Provider Page on or before the date the 
reassigned service commences and are subject to Section 9.1 of this Schedule 18. In accordance with this 
Schedule 18, Transmission Customers may also use the MTF Transmission Provider Page to post 
information regarding transmission capacity over the MTF available for resale.  
 
10.  
Real Power Losses  
Real power losses across MTF shall be allocated solely to Transmission Customers that use MTF. Such 
allocation for transactions across MTF shall be pursuant to the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
11.  
No Obligation to Build  
The MTF Provider status under the OATT shall not impose an obligation to build transmission facilities 
on the MTF Provider. The offering of MTF Service under this OATT shall not impose an obligation to 
build transmission facilities on the Market Participants, Transmission Owners or the ISO.  
 
12.  
No Effect on Rates; No Allocation of Revenues  
MTF and MTF Service shall not affect rates for service on the PTF under this OATT and MTF Providers 
shall not be allocated any revenues collected under this OATT for such service.  
 
13.  
Ancillary Services  
Ancillary Services costs associated with MTF Service shall be assessed pursuant to this Tariff.  
Effective Date: 5/1/2022 - Docket #: ER22-2509-001 
 
 
14.  
Congestion Costs and FTRs  
Pursuant to the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff, Congestion Costs will not be calculated, and 
therefore FTRs will not be offered, between any set of points on the MTF, so long as it remains MTF. 
Transmission Customers taking MTF Service, however, shall be subject to applicable Congestion Costs 
for any use of the PTF.

consistent with FERC procedures regarding OASIS postings.  
 
3.  
Character of Service to be Released  
Unless otherwise posted on the CSC OASIS, all releases of transfer capability will be for Non-Firm MTF 
Service. Such Non-Firm MTF Service may be released on a monthly, weekly, daily or hourly basis. MTF 
Service is unidirectional (i.e. scheduling from New Haven to Shoreham as an export transaction from 
New England or Shoreham to New Haven as an import transaction into New England). The 
characteristics of Firm MTF Service and Non-Firm MTF Service are set forth in Schedule 18 of the ISO-
NE OATT.  
 
4.  
Assignment of Rights Holders’ MTF Service Reservation  
A Rights Holder may separately assign its advance reservation for MTF Service to third parties provided 
that notice of such assignment is provided to CSC LLC and ISO-NE with such information then posted on 
the CSC OASIS. The assignment of such advance reservation may be on either a firm or non-firm basis, 
be in whole or in part, in segments, on a full or partial term basis, with or without recall rights or any 
combination thereof.  
 
5.

b.  
Weekly Releases:  
• No later than 3 calendar days  
 
c.  
Daily Releases:  
• No later than Noon on the day before the Operating Day.  
 
d.  
Hourly Release:  
• No later than Noon on the day before the Operating Day.  
 
The deadlines set forth above address voluntary releases of a Rights Holders’ transfer capability to 
facilitate full access to transfer capability for third parties. Automatic release of transfer capability due to 
a Rights Holders’ failure to schedule transmission service over the CSC is governed by and set forth 
below in the “Default Release” provision.    
 
7.  
Award of Reservations  
Releases of advance reservations for CSC transfer capability and bids for such advance reservations shall 
be submitted to the Transmission Provider via the CSC OASIS.  The award of reservations shall be 
accomplished through either: (1) a public auction process conducted by the Rights Holder, with the 
released capability awarded to the highest bidder; or (2) the posting of released capability at a specified 
rate on the CSC OASIS, with the award of such capability performed on a first-come, first served basis 
for bidders that meet the posted rate for such capability.  The rate for assignment either through a public 
auction process or through a posting on the CSC OASIS shall be as determined by Section 9 of Schedule 
18 of the ISO-NE OATT, and shall be posted on the CSC OASIS.  
 
8.   
Effect of Advance Reservation  
The issuance of an advance reservation is a prerequisite to scheduling an External Transaction in the ISO-
NE Real-Time Energy Market that involves the use of the CSC.  A party holding an advance reservation 
for Firm MTF Service or Non-Firm MTF Service and otherwise meeting the qualifications for submitting 
transactions under the ISO-NE OATT may submit scheduling transactions with ISO-NE that involve the 
submission of a bid/offer at the Shoreham node.    
 
9.   
Default Release  
In the event that a Rights Holder or any other holder of an advance reservation for MTF Service fails to 
submit a schedule for its full MTF Service reservation by Noon of the day prior to the Operating Day, the 
difference between all remaining advance reservations for which accepted bids/offers have been 
submitted to the New England energy market by advance reservation holders and the Total Transfer 
Capability over the CSC in the scheduling hour shall be automatically released for scheduling by third 
parties and posted on the CSC as Available Transfer Capability.  Advance reservations for released 
capability under default release rules will be issued on a first-come, first-served basis through the CSC 
OASIS.    
 
10. 
Priority of Capability Released Under the Default Release Provisions  
Reservations for CSC transfer capability released due to the default release provisions shall be deemed 
Non-Firm MTF Service and assigned the NERC transmission service priority “2” (Hourly Non-Firm).  
 
11.  
Curtailment and Interruptions of Service over MTF  
Curtailment and interruptions of service over the CSC required to be initiated by the System Operator 
pursuant to the ISO-NE system rules or in response to conditions or constraints within the New York 
Control Area identified by the NYISO as requiring curtailment or interruption of service shall be based 
upon transmission priority. For Firm MTF Service, curtailment or interruptions within each reservation 
classification will be performed on a pro rata basis. Curtailment and interruptions within each reservation 
classification of Non-Firm MTF Service (i.e. Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Hourly) will be based upon the 
time stamp associated with the submission of valid bids/offers to the ISO-NE Real-Time Market. 
Curtailments and interruptions of service over the CSC that relate to conditions or constraints on the Pool 
Transmission Facilities that may otherwise affect service over the CSC will be conducted consistent with 
the priorities established in the ISO-NE Operating Procedures. The NYISO is responsible for determining 
the need for any curtailments and interruptions of service relating to conditions or constraints within the 
New York Control Area consistent with the priorities established by the NYISO’s administration of its 
tariffs and procedures and will communicate the need for such curtailments or interruptions to the System 
Operator for implementation in compliance with prescribed NERC Policies.  
 
12.  
Liability  
The Transmission Provider and any Rights Holder releasing its advance reservation through the voluntary 
or default release procedures of these rules shall be held harmless with regard to any claim which may be 
raised by any party regarding the selection of a bid, except to the extent that such party successfully 
establishes that the Transmission Provider or the Rights Holder, as the case may be, has incorrectly 
selected the bidder as the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct.  
 
13.  
Billing  
A party holding advance reservation through releases in accordance with these CSC Releases shall be 
billed by the Transmission Provider and shall make payments to the Transmission Provider in accordance 
with the terms of the Service Agreements and the Transmission Provider shall simultaneously credit (on a 
contingent basis) all reservation charges billed the party releasing such advance reservation. If party 
acquiring advance reservations through releases fails to pay the reservation charges by the due date, the 
Transmission Provider shall reverse the credit and bill the party releasing such advance reservation for 
said reservation charges, plus interest, and the advance reservation shall, at the election of the releasing 
party, revert to the releasing party for the remaining term of the release.

Specifications For MTF Service over the Cross Sound Cable 
 Reserved via the Cross Sound Cable Transmission Provider Page 
 on the ISO-NE OASIS Node 
 
A Transmission Customer must acquire an advance reservation for Firm MTF Service or Non-Firm MTF 
Service. The issuance of an advance reservation is a prerequisite to scheduling an External Transaction 
over the Cross Sound Cable in the ISO New England Real-Time Energy Market. While not required, an 
advance reservation for the ISO New England Day Ahead Market is highly recommended, as absent an 
advance reservation the financial transaction in the Day Ahead Market will not be supported by a 
corresponding External Transaction in the Real-Time Energy market, thus creating significant financial 
risks to the transacting party. A party holding an advance reservation and otherwise meeting the 
qualifications for submitting transactions under the ISO New England, Inc. (“ISO-NE”) Transmission, 
Markets and Services Tariff (“Tariff”) may submit scheduling transactions over the Cross Sound Cable 
with ISO-NE up to the total MW amount of the advance reservation.

SCHEDULE 18 - ATTACHMENT C 
Cross-Sound Cable TTC, CBM, TRM and ATC Methodology 
Version 2.0;  Issued: December 22, 2010 
 
1.  
Introduction  
Cross-Sound Cable (“CSC”) is an HVDC Transmission Facility located between New Haven, CT and 
Shoreham, NY (Long Island).  The CSC is owned and operated by Cross-Sound Cable Company, LLC 
(“CSC LLC”).  CSC LLC operates as Transmission Service Provider (“TSP”) for the CSC, which is a 
Merchant Transmission Facility (“MTF”) within the ISO New England (“ISO-NE”) regional transmission 
organization (“RTO”).  ISO-NE serves the New England states through reliable minute to minute 
operation of the New England Bulk Power System; development, oversight, and fair administration of 
New England’s wholesale market; and management of comprehensive bulk electric power system and 
wholesale markets' planning processes.  ISO-NE serves as the Balancing Authority for the New England 
Area (“ISO-NE Area”). The ISO-NE Area is interconnected to three neighboring Balancing Authority 
Areas (“BAAs”): New Brunswick System Operator Balancing Authority Area (“NBSO BAA”), New 
York Independent System Operator Balancing Authority Area (“NYISO BAA”), and Hydro-Quebec 
TransEnergie Balancing Authority Area (“HQTE BAA”).  As the RTO for New England, ISO-NE 
performs the reliability functions related to the calculation of Total Transfer Capability (“TTC”) for all of 
the external interfaces between the ISO Area and its neighboring Balancing Authority Areas and for the 
internal interfaces between the Pool Transmission Facilities (“PTF”), Other Transmission Facilities 
(“OTF”) and MTF such as the CSC.  As a TSP offering MTF service pursuant to Schedule 18 of the ISO-
NE Tariff, CSC LLC retains the responsibility for determining and posting the Available Transfer 
Capability (“ATC”) of its facilities.

1.2.  
Overview of Cross-Sound Cable  
The Cross-Sound Cable is a 330 MW High Voltage Direct Current Merchant Transmission Facility with 
associated AC/DC converter stations that are directly interconnected with the 345 kV PTF in New Haven, 
CT at the East Shore substation, and 138 kV transmission facilities at the Shoreham substation in Long 
Island, NY. Firm Transmission Service for the entire transfer capability of the CSC was awarded to Long 
Island Power Authority (“LIPA”) through an allocation process approved by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). To the extent that the entire capacity of this firm Existing 
Transmission Commitment (“ETCF”) is unused by LIPA, secondary rights to use the MTF service is 
offered on an hourly non-firm basis for the remaining ATC through non-firm Existing Transmission 
Commitment (“ETCNF”). CSC ATC is described in section 5 below.  
 
2.  
CSC Total Transfer Capability (“TTC”)  
The Total Transfer Capability or TTC for an interface is the best engineering estimate of the total amount 
of electric power that can be transferred over the interface in a reliable manner in a given time frame. 
ISO-NE, acting as the Transmission Operator (“TOP”), determines the TTC for the Cross-Sound Cable 
based on the equipment ratings and availability provided by CSC LLC and system conditions, then posts 
the TTC on the ISO-NE OASIS Node. Due to the controllable and bi-directional nature of CSC, it is 
treated as two separate and independent transmission paths for scheduling purposes.  Flow from ISO-NE 
to NYISO is treated as Export with a maximum TTC of 330 MW delivered, while flow from NYISO to 
ISO-NE is treated as Import with a maximum TTC of 346 MW received. Cross-Sound Cable is operated 
in accordance with the requirements of TTC methodology are addressed in Sections 1 and 3 of the ISO-
NE document “Attachment C Available Transfer Capability Methodology”.  
 
3.  
CSC Capacity Benefit Margin (“CBM”)  
The use of Capacity Benefit Margin or CBM within the ISO-NE Area is governed by the overall ISO-NE 
approach to capacity planning requirements. Load Serving Entities (“LSEs”) operating within the ISO 
Area do not utilize CBM to ensure their capacity needs are met; therefore CBM is not applicable within 
the New England market design. Accordingly, for the purpose of ATC calculation, CBM for the New 
England Control Area, including CSC, is set to zero (0). For additional information on CBM, refer to 
Section 4 of the ISO-NE document “Attachment C Available Transfer Capability Methodology”.  
 
 
 
4.  
CSC Transmission Reliability Margin (“TRM”)  
Effective Date:  2/1/2024 – ER23-1774-000 
The Transmission Reliability Margin or TRM is the amount of transmission transfer capability set aside 
to provide reasonable assurance that the interconnected transmission network will be secure. TRM 
accounts for the inherent uncertainty in system conditions and the need for operating flexibility to ensure 
reliable system operation as the system conditions change.   
 
ISO-NE, acting as a Transmission Operator, calculates the TRM on the CSC MTF interface by taking into 
account any operational uncertainties with CSC in accordance with MOD-008. Typically the operational 
uncertainties associated with an external HVDC facility are minimal and result in a TRM value of zero 
(0), as is the case for CSC.  
 
For additional information on TRM, refer to Section 5.2.1 Calculation of TRM for the MTF and OTF of 
the ISO-NE document “Attachment C Available Transfer Capability Methodology”.  
 
5.  
CSC Available Transfer Capability (“ATC”)  
This section defines the Available Transfer Capability calculations performed for MTF service over the 
CSC. The general equation for calculation of ATC is derived from MOD-029 as follows:  
 
ATC = TTC – ETC – CBM – TRM + Postbacks + Counterflows  
 
The CBM and TRM Values have been previously discussed (CBM = 0, TRM = 0). The purpose of the 
ETC component of the ATC equation is for the TSP to define all elements that are reducing the amount of 
ATC available to market participants. Details regarding the ETC component, Postbacks and Counterflows 
of the ATC calculation and its impact on Firm and Non-firm ATC are described below.  
 
5.1.  
Firm ATC for MTF Transmission Services  
Firm Available Transfer Capability (“ATCF”) is defined as the capability for firm transmission 
reservations that remains after allowing for CBM, TRM and firm existing transmission commitments. As 
described in Section 1.2, CSC LLC has a long term contract with LIPA for Yearly Firm Transmission 
Service for the entire transfer capability of the CSC.  
 
Firm ATC is calculated using the following equation:  
 
ATCF = TTC – ETCF – CBM – TRM + PostbacksF + CounterflowsF  
Where 
Effective Date:  2/1/2024 – ER23-1774-000 
ATCF is the firm Available Transfer Capability for the ATC path during the period. 
TTC is the Total Transfer Capability for the ATC path during the period. 
ETCF is the sum of firm Existing Transmission Commitments scheduled by LIPA in the Day Ahead 
 
Market, under contractual agreement, for the ATC path during the period. 
CBM is set to 0 by ISO-NE per section 3 of this document. 
TRM is set to 0 by ISO-NE per section 4 of this document. 
PostbacksF is set to 0 because any changes to the ATCF would be released as secondary market 
 
capacity resulting in a change to the ETCNF value used to determine the resulting ATCNF. 
CounterflowsF is set to 0 because Export point-to-point flow and Import point-to-point flow are treated as 
 
two independent directional paths. Since CSC calculates ATC in both directions independently, 
 
there are no Counterflows by definition. 
 
Essentially, ATCF is equal to zero (0) as ETCF owned by LIPA over both directions of flow is equal to the 
entire TTC.  The ATCF will be equal to the TTC until LIPA schedules their actual transfers in the Day 
Ahead Market.  At this point, any portion of the ETCF that LIPA does not schedule will get released into 
the hourly market as ATCNF. 
 
 
5.2.  
Non-Firm ATC for MTF Transmission Services  
Non-firm Available Transfer Capability (“ATCNF”) is defined as the capability for non-firm transmission 
reservations that remain after allowing for CBM, TRM, ETCF and non-firm Existing Transmission 
Commitments (“ETCNF”) that have been Confirmed and Accepted. Although the entire TTC of the CSC is 
contracted to LIPA for Yearly Firm Transmission Service, any portion of the capacity that is not 
scheduled by LIPA in the Day-Ahead market will be released on an hourly non-firm basis. Customers 
may then purchase capacity in the Hourly Market, creating an ETCNF contract which will in turn reduce 
the ATCNF. Incorporating this into the determination of ATC, non-firm ATC is calculated using the 
following equation:  
 
 
ATCNF = TTC – ETCF – ETCNF – CBMS – TRMU + PostbacksNF + CounterflowsNF  
 
Where 
ATCNF is the non-firm Available Transfer Capability for the ATC path during the period. 
TTC is the Total Transfer Capability for the ATC path during the period. 
ETCF is the sum of firm Existing Transmission Commitments scheduled by LIPA in the Day Ahead 
Effective Date:  2/1/2024 – ER23-1774-000 
 
Market, under contractual agreement, for the ATC path during the period. 
ETCNF is the sum of non-firm Existing Transmission Commitments purchased by Secondary Market 
 
Customers in the Hourly Market, for the ATC path during the period. 
CBM is set to 0 by ISO-NE per section 3 of this document. 
TRM is set to 0 by ISO-NE per section 4 of this document. 
PostbacksNF is set to 0 because any changes to the non-firm ATC would be re-released as secondary 
 
market capacity resulting in a change to the ETCNF value. 
CounterflowsNF is set to 0 because Export point-to-point flow and Import point-to-point flow are treated 
 
as two independent directional paths. Since CSC calculates ATC in both directions 
 
independently, there are no Counterflows by definition. 
 
Additional capacity may be purchased for MTF service on an Hourly non-firm basis until the ATCNF 
equals zero (0) for the subject path. Purchases may take place on both paths individually up to their full 
TTC, which would effectively result in no transfer across CSC.  In no case would purchases on one path 
result in increased ATC on the other path. 
 
 
6.  
Posting of CSC ATC  
 
6.1.  
ATC Values  
Using the process described in Section 5 above, the ATC calculations are performed for CSC 
automatically by the scheduling software. The ATC values for CSC are determined using the 
Mathematical Algorithms for Calculation of ATC 
(https://www.oasis.oati.com/CSC/CSCdocs/Algorithms_for_ATC_Calculation_for_CSC.pdf) and posted in 
accordance with NAESB standards on the CSC OASIS (https://www.oasis.oati.com/csc/index.html).  
 
As discussed, firm ATC is equal to zero at all times. LIPA determines the ETCF for the next day prior to 
noon eastern prevailing time of each operating day. CSC LLC then resets the Operating Horizon (“OH”) 
through the scheduling software. The OH spans from noon of the current day through midnight of the 
next day, or for the next 36 hours calculating ATCNF based on the ETCF selected by LIPA. ATCNF is 
calculated from the TTC and ETCF and offered as non-firm Hourly MTF in the OH.  Subsequent Capacity 
purchases are considered ETCNF, which is then subtracted from the ATCNF. Any changes to the ATCNF 
are updated in real time through the scheduling software.

SCHEDULE 18 – ATTACHMENT L  
Creditworthiness Procedures 
 
I.  
Overview  
The creditworthiness of each Transmission Customer seeking MTF Service must be established before 
receiving service from the MTF Provider. The MTF Provider shall make this credit review in accordance 
with procedures based on specific quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine the level of secured 
and unsecured credit required from the Transmission Customer. A summary of the MTF Provider’s 
Creditworthiness Requirements are described in this Attachment L to Schedule 18. Detailed information 
regarding the MTF Provider’s Creditworthiness Requirements is available in the MTF Provider’s 
Business Practices as posted on the MTF Transmission Provider Page on the OASIS.  
 
II.  
Financial Information  
Transmission Customers requesting MTF Service will be required to provide credit rating and financial 
information as part of the Credit Application for MTF Service. Required information may include: (a) all 
current credit rating reports from commercially accepted credit rating agencies including Standard and 
Poor’s Inc. (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”); (b) financial 
statements audited by a registered independent auditor; and (c) references from banks and 
utilities/vendors.  
 
III.  
Creditworthiness Requirements and Process  
Transmission Customers, rated and un-rated, will be required to meet the creditworthiness requirements 
specified in this Attachment L to Schedule 18 and the MTF Business Practices. Credit rating and financial 
information provided by Transmission Customers that would be used to establish creditworthiness 
include investment grade ratings for senior unsecured long-term debt and ratio analyses of audited 
financial statements. If the Customer does not meet the MTF Provider’s creditworthiness requirements, 
the MTF Provider (at its discretion) may establish a credit limit for that Customer equal to the financial 
assurance (i.e., the security deposit) required from all Transmission Customers, as specified in this 
Attachment L to Schedule 18 and the MTF Provider’s Business Practices.  
 
The MTF Provider shall use the following criteria in reviewing the creditworthiness of Transmission 
Customers:  
 
Effective Date:  2/1/2024 – ER23-1774-000 
1. 
The Transmission Customer must meet and maintain the credit and financial assurance 
requirements applicable to market participants as established by ISO New England Inc.; and  
 
2. 
The Transmission Customer must not be in default of any amounts owed to any MTF Providers.  
 
If the Transmission Customer does not qualify using the above requirements, the MTF Provider may 
consider other qualitative factors on a case-by-case basis. The specific factors will depend upon the MTF 
Provider’s Business Practices, and may include billing history and the Transmission Customer’s 
anticipated use of the MTF service.  
 
A.  
Procedure for Determining Creditworthiness  
The MTF Service Credit Application is posted on the MTF Provider’s OASIS and is available for 
download. The Credit Application may be submitted along with the Application for MTF Transmission 
Service. Because the amount of time required to complete the credit review varies widely, it is 
recommended that credit applications be submitted at least ten (10) business days before the Transmission 
Customer takes service for the first time. As part of the credit review process, the MTF Provider will 
assign a credit limit to each Transmission Customer. For a customer that holds a below investment grade 
rating from either S&P, Moody’s or Fitch, or is not rated by any of those three rating agencies, the 
assigned credit limit will be the amount of the security deposit posted by such customer. For a customer 
that is rated by one or more of S&P, Moody’s or Fitch and holds an investment grade rating from each 
agency that rates that customer, the credit limit will be established using standard commercial practices on 
a case-by-case basis based on an estimate of the customer’s anticipated use of MTF Service.  
 
IV.  
Financial Assurance  
All Transmission Customers requesting MTF Service are required to submit a security deposit to the MTF 
Provider. For customers executing a Blanket MTF Transmission Service Agreement, the minimum 
security deposit shall be $100,000.00, provided, however, that customers may choose to provide a higher 
security deposit. For customers executing a transaction-specific MTF Transmission Service Agreement, 
the security deposit requirement shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, the maximum security 
deposit that may be charged is equal to the cost of the Reserved Capacity over the MTF for the duration 
of the specific transaction. Security deposits will be held in separate accounts. Account statements will be 
provided to the customer on an annual basis upon request.  
 
 
Effective Date:  2/1/2024 – ER23-1774-000 
V.  
Credit Levels  
Transmission Customers meeting the above Creditworthiness Requirements will be extended credit based 
on levels specified in the MTF Provider’s Business Practices. Transmission Customers that do not meet 
the MTF Provider’s creditworthiness requirements will not receive unsecured credit from the MTF 
Provider. The MTF Provider will monitor the credit status of all approved customers and may modify 
credit limits (higher or lower) for such customer to the extent that company circumstances or service 
changes occur. In the event that a customer is downgraded such that it holds a below investment grade 
rating from S&P, Moody’s or Fitch, or is not rated by any of the three agencies, the customer’s credit 
limit shall be immediately reduced to the amount of security deposit posted by that customer.  
 
VI.  
Contesting Creditworthiness Determination  
Should the MTF Provider reject a credit application, the MTF Provider will provide the customer the 
reasons for the rejection and an opportunity to revise and resubmit the credit application to address the 
identified deficiencies. Transmission Customers may also contest the MTF Provider’s determination of 
creditworthiness by submitting a written request for re-evaluation. Such request should provide 
information supporting the basis for a request to re-evaluate a Transmission Customer’s creditworthiness. 
The MTF Provider will review and respond to the request under the procedures outlined in this 
Attachment L to Schedule 18 and the MTF Provider’s Business Practices.  
 
VII.  
Procedures for Changes in Credit Levels and Collateral Requirements  
The MTF Provider will immediately notify customers of any modifications to credit limits or required 
security deposits. Upon request, the MTF Provider will provide customers a written explanation for any 
change in credit limits or required security deposits, including an opportunity to cure any credit 
deficiencies within a specified time period.  
 
VIII.  Posting Collateral Requirements  
In the event that the MTF Providers revises the level of collateral required (e.g., security deposit) as a 
result of changes to the Transmission Customer’s financial information, the MTF Provider’s criteria, or 
other events that result in the Transmission Customer being determined to be non-creditworthy, the 
Transmission Customer shall have the opportunity to cure such deficiency consistent with the procedures 
in this Attachment L to Schedule 18 and the MTF Provider’s Business Practices, as posted on the MTF 
Transmission Provider Page on the OASIS.  
 
 
Effective Date:  2/1/2024 – ER23-1774-000 
IX.  
Additional Requirements  
Along with the above criteria for determining creditworthiness, the MTF Provider may require the 
Transmission Customer to fulfill additional conditions under the MTF Provider’s Business Practices, as 
posted on the MTF Transmission Provider Page on the OASIS.

SCHEDULE 19  
SPECIAL CONSTRAINT RESOURCE SERVICE 
 
In order to maintain area reliability, Transmission Owners or distribution companies may request the ISO to 
change the commitment of a generating Resource or the incremental loading on a previously committed 
generating Resource to provide relief for constraints not reflected in the ISO’s systems for operating the 
New England Transmission System or adhering to the ISO’s Operating Procedures. Requests will normally 
be made to the ISO via the appropriate Local Control Center unless emergency conditions justify 
immediate communications with the Resources.  
 
Such out of merit operation of units for any reliability purposes to provide relief for constraints (thermal, 
voltage or stability) not reflected in the ISO’s systems or Operating Procedures will result in the 
Resource(s) being designated as a Special Constraint Resource (SCR) and administered in accordance with 
the provisions of this Schedule. However, in the event a SCR is requested by a Transmission Owner or 
distribution company and the ISO also requires that unit to be on-line in accordance with the ISO’s systems 
and procedures, the ISO will apply the appropriate flag to reflect the ISO’s need for the unit and will only 
flag the unit as SCR when the ISO does not require the Resource (or when changed dispatch of the unit is 
requested by the Market Participant).  When a unit would not be operating above its Economic Minimum 
Limit but for the request of the Transmission Owner or distribution company , it shall be flagged as SCR. In 
the event that the ISO requires that a unit, previously designated and flagged as SCR, becomes a unit 
required by the ISO to be on-line in accordance with the ISO’s systems and procedures (including economic 
dispatch or for purposes of second contingency, first contingency or capacity), the SCR designation and 
flag will be removed.  
 
I.  
DETERMINING THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID FOR SERVICE UNDER THIS 
SCHEDULE  
Service under this Schedule is to be provided by the ISO.  The Transmission Owner or distribution 
company making a request or on whose behalf a Local Control Center makes a request to change the 
commitment of a generating Resource or the incremental loading on a previously committed generating 
Resource must purchase such service from the ISO.  The Transmission Owner or distribution company 
shall be charged an amount equal to the NCPC Credit (as calculated pursuant to Market Rule 1) associated 
with the Real-Time operation of the Special Constraint Resource.  
 
 
 
II.  
DETERMINING A GENERATOR’S COMPENSATION FOR PROVIDING SERVICE 
UNDER THIS SCHEDULE  
The Special Constraint Resource is compensated pursuant to Market Rule 1 in the same manner as other 
generating Resources dispatched to provide relief for constraints reflected in the ISO’s systems for 
operating the New England Transmission System or the ISO’s Operating Procedures. NCPC Credits 
associated with the scheduling of Special Constraint Resources compensate these Resources for helping to 
maintain New England Control Area reliability requirements and are collected as stated in the ISO Manual 
for Market Rule 1 Accounting, M-28.

Introduction  
 
ISO is the regional transmission organization (RTO) for the New England Control Area.  The New 
England Control Area includes the transmission system located in the states of Connecticut, Maine, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, but does not include the transmission 
system in northern Maine (i.e., Aroostook and parts of Penobscot and Washington Counties) that is 
radially connected to New Brunswick and administered by the Northern Maine Independent System 
Administrator.  The New England Control Area is comprised of PTF, non-PTF, OTF, MTF, and is 
interconnected to three neighboring Balancing Authority Areas (“BAA”) with various interface types as 
shown in the Table 1.  A graphical depiction of the New England Control Area and its interfaces is 
provided in Figure 1.

ISO Responsibilities 
 
As part of its RTO responsibilities, the ISO is registered with the North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation (“NERC”) as several functional model entities that have responsibilities related to the 
calculation of ATC as defined in the following NERC Standards:  MOD-001 – Available Transmission 
System Capability (“MOD-001”), MOD-004 – Capability Benefit Margin (“MOD-004”), and MOD-008 -
Transmission Reliability Margin Calculation Methodology (“MOD-008”).  The extent of those 
responsibilities is based on various Commission approved transmission operating agreements and the 
provisions of the ISO New England Operating Documents.  Table 2 below depicts those responsibilities 
as they apply to the interfaces associated with the New England Control Area and its neighboring BAAs 
for which the ISO is the Transmission Operator (“TOP”) and has varying responsibilities with respect to 
the calculation of ATC over those interfaces.

1.2. 
 Applicability of this Attachment C 
 
This Attachment C describes the ATC methodology for RNS and Through or Out Service, and also 
describes the methodology for certain ATC components that are calculated by the ISO for use by other 
TSPs as described below: 
 
• 
The TTC methodology for use by CSC, LLC under Schedule 18 and the SSPs under Schedule 
20A. 
• 
The CBM methodology for use by CSC, LLC under Schedule 18 and SSPs under Schedule 20A. 
• 
The TRM methodology for use by CSC, LLC under Schedule 18 and the SSPs under Schedule 
20A.  
 
The manner in which these ISO-calculated ATC components are used by CSC, LLC and the SSPs for 
purposes of calculating a Schedule-specific ATC is governed by Schedules 18 and 20A, respectively. 
 
2.  
Transmission Service in the New England Markets  
 
Since the inception of the OATT for New England, the process by which generation located inside New 
England supplies energy to the bulk electric system has differed from the Commission pro forma OATT.  
The fundamental difference is that internal generation is dispatched in an economic, security-constrained 
manner by the ISO rather than utilizing a system of physical rights, advance reservations and point-to-
point transmission service. Through this process, internal generation provides offers that are utilized by 
the ISO in the Real-Time Energy Market dispatch software. This process provides the least-cost dispatch 
to satisfy Real-Time load on the system.  
 
In addition to offers from generation within New England, entities may submit External Transactions to 
move energy into the New England Control Area, out of the New England Control Area or through the 
New England Control Area. The Real-Time Energy Market clears these External Transactions based on 
forecast LMPs and the transfer capability of the associated external interfaces. With those External 
Transactions in place, the Real-Time Energy Market dispatches internal generation in an economic, 
security constrained manner to meet Real-Time load within the region.  
 
The process for submitting External Transactions into the Real-Time Energy Market does not require an 
advance physical reservation for use of the PTF. In the event that the net of the economic External 
Transactions is greater than the transfer capability of the associated external interface, the External 
Transactions selected to flow are selected based on the rules specified in the Tariff. For any External 
Transactions that are confirmed to flow in Real-Time based on the economics of the system, a 
transmission reservation for RNS and Through or Out Service is created after-the-fact to satisfy the 
transparency needs of the market; however, entities who want to submit an External Transaction to flow 
energy over an MTF or OTF external interface must first obtain a confirmed transmission service 
reservation from the respective TSP prior to offering energy into the Real-Time Energy Market. Entities 
who want to submit an External Transaction to flow energy over an MTF or OTF external interface may 
refer to Schedule 18 or 20A for information regarding the calculation of ATC on the MTF and OTF 
external interfaces, respectively 
 
The values resulting from the methodologies described in this Attachment C relate solely to the flow of 
energy in the Real-Time Energy Market, and shall not be construed as defining methodologies or limits 
for use in other New England markets.  
 
3.  
Total Transfer Capability (TTC) for the New England Control Area 
  
The TTCs on all of the New England Control Area external interfaces are calculated using the NERC 
Standard MOD-029 – Rated System Path Methodology (“MOD-029”).  Consistent with the NERC 
definition, TTC is the amount of electric power that can be moved or transferred reliably from one area to 
another area of the interconnected transmission systems by way of all transmission lines (or paths) 
between those areas under specified system conditions.  TTCs for the New England Control Area external 
interfaces are studied by the ISO based on thermal, voltage and stability limitations of the transmission 
lines that comprise the interface.  Power flow and transient stability analysis is used to ensure that the 
interface’s physical limits will not be violated for credible system contingencies per NPCC and ISO 
reliability criteria.  As required by MOD-029, reports are generated that contain the study results and the 
corresponding TTCs.   
 
These reports are reviewed and updated seasonally, as needed, or as new equipment is placed in-service 
that impacts the interface.  The studies identify the transmission facilities, generators and system 
conditions that can have a substantial impact upon the transfer capability and, where applicable, the report 
indicates the resulting impact upon the transfer capability of the external interfaces.  These reports are 
available in a manner consistent with the ISO New England Information Policy. 
 
The NPCC region maintains, on a confidential basis, a list of generation and transmission facilities that, if 
removed from service, may have a significant direct or indirect impact on a neighboring BAA, which is in 
accordance with Appendix F – Procedure for Operational Planning Coordination (Appendix F) to NPCC 
Regional Reliability Reference Director #1 – Design and Operation of the Bulk Power System (Directory 
#1). If any facilities on that list have a planned outage, those outages are communicated between the 
neighboring BAAs. If there is a facility on that list in the New England Control Area that is submitted for 
an outage by an entity, the ISO conducts a study using an energy management system powerflow model 
and evaluates the impact on the TTC of the affected interface. The ISO applies its load forecast and 
generation dispatch for the relevant time frame to determine the TTCs for the given condition. In addition, 
on a daily basis, ISO evaluates the expected New England Control Area system conditions (e.g., 
generation availability, transmission outages, submitted External Transactions, resulting expected net 
flow across an external interface) for the following day to determine if there is a system operating limit 
that has a direct impact upon an external interface that is more restrictive than the previously calculated 
TTC and, if so, revises the TTC. TTCs impact the maximum megawatt (“MW”) amount of confirmed net 
flow in the Real-Time Energy Market, and may be adjusted prior to Real-Time to reflect Real-Time 
system operating limits.  However, the TTCs in the direction opposite to the prevailing net flow are 
neither reviewed nor adjusted prior to Real-Time, since those values do not affect reliability. 
 
4.  Capacity Benefit Margin (CBM) for the New England Control Area 
 
CBM is defined as the amount of firm transmission transfer capability set aside by a TSP for use by the 
Load Serving Entities.  The ISO does not set aside any CBM for use by the Load Serving Entities, 
because of the New England approach to capacity planning requirements in the ISO New England 
Operating Documents. Load Serving Entities operating within the New England Control Area are 
required to arrange for their Capacity Requirements prior to the beginning of any given month in 
accordance with ISO Tariff, Section III 13.7.3.1 (Calculation of Capacity Requirement and Capacity Load 
Obligation). Load Serving Entities do not utilize CBM to ensure that their capacity needs are met; 
therefore, CBM is not applicable within the New England market design.  Accordingly, for purposes of 
ATC calculation, CBM for the New England Control Area is set to zero (0).  
 
5.  
Transmission Reliability Margin (TRM) for the New England Control Area 
 
TRM is the amount of transmission transfer capability set aside to provide reasonable assurance that the 
interconnected transmission network will be secure.  TRM accounts for the inherent uncertainty in system 
conditions and the need for operating flexibility to ensure reliable system operation as system conditions 
change.  
 
5.1 
TRM Calculation for the PTF 
 
The ISO, acting as the TOP and TSP, does not set aside TRM on PTF external interfaces or PTF/MTF 
and PTF/OTF internal interfaces. 
 
5.2 
TRM Calculation for the MTF and OTF 
 
The ISO, acting as the TOP, calculates the TRM on MTF and OTF external interfaces, which are both 
HVDC transmission facilities, by taking into account any operational uncertainties associated with the 
external facility in accordance with MOD-008. 
 
The TSPs responsible for calculating the ATC and providing transmission service over the MTF or OTF 
dictate how the ISO-calculated TRM is applied in their respective Schedule-specific ATC calculations.   
 
5.2.1 
TRM Calculation for the MTF 
 
Typically, the operational uncertainties associated with an external HVDC transmission facility are 
minimal and result in a TRM value of zero (0).  Therefore, the TRM value for the MTF (i.e., CSC 
transmission facility) is zero (0). 
 
5.2.2 
TRM Calculation for the OTF 
 
5.2.2.1 Quebec to New England TRM for the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities 
 
There are operational uncertainties associated with the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities that arise 
out of neighboring and nearby BAAs such that the TRM on this facility is not zero (0).  Due to the large 
transfer capability of the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities and the geographic location of the 
New England Control Area with respect to the rest of the Eastern Interconnection, the loss of this facility 
may have a substantial impact on the New York and Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland (“PJM”) 
transmission systems.  The inertial impact from the loss of the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities 
on the New York and PJM transmission systems will be dependent upon the simultaneous path 
interactions and the generation dispatch on those transmission systems and within the New England 
Control Area. 
 
As such, pursuant to Attachment G of the ISO Tariff, the Reliability Coordinators in New York and PJM 
can require the ISO to limit the amount of energy transferred into the New England Control Area over the 
Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities (or the output from other large source contingencies within the 
New England Control Area) in Real-Time to a value as low as 1200 MW, which is referred to as the 
“largest single source contingency limit”.  The amount of energy transferred into the New England 
Control Area over the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities is not always limited to 1200 MW; it is 
also dependent upon the dynamic state of the New York and PJM transmission systems, as well as, the 
additional room (or “available margin”) on those systems that can reliably sustain the inertial response 
following the loss of the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities (or other large source contingencies 
within the New England Control Area) when the amount of energy transferred into the New England 
Control Area over the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities (or the output from other large source 
contingencies within the New England Control Area) in Real-Time is in amounts greater than 1200 MW.  
For these reasons, the TRM value for the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities for all time horizons 
in the importing direction (North to South) shall be between zero (0) MW and 800 MW, where 800 MW 
is calculated from the “Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities maximum transfer capability” (which is 
2000 MW) minus the “largest single source contingency limit” (which is 1200 MW). 
 
This range of TRM values is not dependent upon any databases, but instead is driven by the magnitude of 
the largest single source contingency in the New England Control Area that the New York and PJM 
transmission systems is able to sustain following the loss of the largest contingent resource. 
 
5.2.2.2 New England to Quebec TRM for the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities: 
 
When energy is flowing from the New England Control Area to the Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie BAA 
(South to North) over the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities, Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie may 
restrict the energy flow due to uncertainties on their Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie transmission system.  
The ISO considers whatever Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie restrictions are submitted to it in the calculation 
of the New England to Quebec TRM for the Phase I/II HVDC Transmission Facilities. 
 
6.  
Available Transfer Capability (ATC) Calculation of PTF Interfaces 
 
This section describes the process for the ATC calculations performed by the ISO pursuant to MOD-029 
for the PTF external interfaces and the PTF/MTF and PTF/OTF internal interfaces.  This section does not 
describe the process for the ATC calculations performed by other New England TSPs.  
 
6.1 
ATC Algorithm:  Process for ATC Calculation for PTF Interfaces 
 
Consistent with the NERC definition, the equation for Available Transfer Capability is: ATC = (TTC – 
CBM – TRM – Existing Transmission Commitments + Postbacks + counterflows).  As discussed above, 
the CBM and TRM for the PTF interfaces for which the ISO calculates ATC are zero (0). The purpose of 
the Existing Transmission Commitments (“ETC”) component of the ATC equation is for the TSP to 
reduce the amount of ATC by the amount of existing firm transmission commitments that are not 
otherwise included in CBM or TRM.  As described in Section 2 of this Attachment C, there is no 
requirement to purchase transmission service in advance of flowing energy in Real-Time, and there is no 
MW amount set aside by the ISO on any interface.  Therefore there are no Existing Transmission 
Commitments to be applied in the ATC equation. For this reason, ETC equals zero (0) for the purposes of 
ATC calculation.  Because Postbacks and counterflows are related to ETC and ETC is zero (0), both 
Postbacks and counterflows also are equal to zero (0). 
 
Entities submit their bids and offers to move energy into, out of and through the Energy Market through 
External Transactions.  As Real-Time approaches, the ISO determines which of the submitted External 
Transactions will be scheduled during the applicable scheduling interval in accordance with the rules set 
forth in the ISO New England Operating Documents.  The ATC of the PTF external interfaces are equal 
to the TTC for all time horizons (i.e., scheduling, operating and planning).  The ATC is equal to the 
amount of net External Transactions that the ISO will schedule on an interface for during the applicable 
scheduling interval.  With this simplified version of ATC, the mathematical algorithm is simply “ATC 
equals TTC.”  This mathematical algorithm can be found on the ISO New England OASIS site at:  
http://www.oatioasis.com/ISNE/ISNEdocs/isone_atc_algorithm.docx  
 
The scheduling of External Transactions on a PTF interface will consider the net of all economic External 
Transactions and the transfer limits.  For example, if the transfer limit on the interface is 1000 MW 
import, there could be 1300 MW of economic import External Transactions and 300 MW of economic 
export External Transactions scheduled for a given scheduling interval such that the net flow on the 
interface is 1000 MW.  
 
Figure 2 describes how External Transactions are processed in the Real-Time Energy Markets where the 
timing of the submittal of the External Transactions is governed by Section III of the ISO Tariff.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Processing of External Transactions in the Real-Time Energy Markets 
 
6.2.  
Firm versus Non-Firm ATC on PTF Interfaces 
 
As described in the preceding sections, the RNS and Through or Out Service provided over the PTF on an 
after-the-fact basis are the equivalent of firm transmission service. Therefore, the ATC calculation 
process described above results in a single ATC value.  Where industry standards or software require the 
classification of ATC as Firm and non-Firm the ISO posts the single ATC value for both.  
 
6.3.  
ATC Coordination for PTF Interfaces  
 
As described in this Section 6 of this Attachment C, the ATC calculations for PTF external interfaces 
performed by the ISO are dependent solely on the TTC values. As such, the ISO does not coordinate ATC 
values with the neighboring BAAs. The ISO, however, has established procedures within the ISO New 
England Operating Procedures for coordinating outages with neighboring BAAs that could impact the 
resulting TTC on the external interface(s) with that neighbor. These procedures also include the timely 
communication of the resulting TTCs between the ISO and each of its neighboring BAAs.  
 
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Transmission Service Agreement to be executed by 
their respective authorized officials.

METHODOLOGY FOR COMPLETING A SYSTEM IMPACT STUDY 
 
The system impact study will be performed to evaluate the impact of the requested service on the reliability 
and operating characteristics of the ISO bulk power system, consistent with:  
• 
Good utility practice  
• 
ERO standards, guides, and procedures;  
• 
NPCC criteria and guidelines;  
• 
New England criteria, rules, procedures, and reliability standards;  
• 
Applicable guides, standards, and criteria of the impacted Transmission Owner(s), whether PTF, 
MTF or OTF;  
• 
Other applicable guidelines and standards which may need to be established from time to time.  
 
As such, the study will examine the impact on the ISO regional bulk power system and its component 
systems and neighboring and external systems. Consistent with the aforementioned, the ability to operate 
the system subject to the following will be considered:  
• 
All equipment within its applicable capabilities;  
• 
Voltages and reactive reserves within acceptable levels;  
• 
Stability maintained with adequate levels of damping;  
• 
Frequency (Hz) within acceptable levels.  
 
The study will consider the reliability requirements to meet existing and pending obligations of the Market 
Participants and the obligations of the impacted Transmission Owner(s).  
 
The study will be performed using appropriate and suitable analysis tools and modeling data consistent with 
the nature and duration of the requested service. It is expected that the Eligible Customer will provide the 
information as prescribed in Exhibit 1 of Attachment I, and such other information as may be reasonably 
required and associated with the requested service and necessary for its study. It is also recognized that it 
may be determined that additional or specialized analysis tools or computer software are necessary for the 
study. The responsibility for the provision of these items will be subject to the System Impact Study 
Agreement.  
 
 
 
The study will identify if the requested service or a portion of it can be provided without adverse impact on 
the reliability and operating characteristics of the system. The study will also identify if it appears that 
modification of the system is necessary to provide the service.

ATTACHMENT F 
ANNUAL TRANSMISSION REVENUE REQUIREMENTS 
 
This Attachment and its Appendices set forth details with respect to the determination each year of the 
Annual Transmission Revenue Requirements for each PTO. Such Annual Transmission Revenue 
Requirements shall reflect the PTO’s total costs to own, operate and maintain the transmission 
facilities used for providing Open Access Transmission Service to transmission customers under this 
Tariff, and such costs shall be recorded in accordance with FERC’s Uniform System of Accounts (18 
C.F.R. Part 101) by those PTOs that are public utilities as that term is defined in Section 201(e) of the 
FPA (“Public Utility PTOs”) and may be recorded according to comparable systems of accounts by 
any PTOs described in Section 201(f) of the FPA (“Section 201(f) PTOs”).  The Annual Transmission 
Revenue Requirements will be determined as set forth in Appendix A, Appendix B, and the 
Attachments to Appendix B, and will be an annual calculation based in part on the previous calendar 
year’s data as shown, in the case of Public Utility PTOs, in the PTO’s FERC Form 1 report for that 
year, and, in the case of Section 201(f) PTOs, in audited financial statements or another Applicable 
Form (as defined in the Protocols).  If two or more PTOs jointly own transmission facilities that consist 
of both PTF Transmission Plant and non-PTF Transmission Plant, a joint owner may use the 
accounting records of the lead owner to determine the portion of such jointly-owned facilities that 
constitute PTF Transmission Plant for purposes of the calculations in this Attachment F.  If a PTO is 
deemed to own or support PTF as defined in Section II.49 of the Tariff, such PTO may include the 
costs as incurred by its Related Person for Pool Supported PTF facilities and Transmission Support 
Expenses in calculating its initial and subsequent Annual Transmission Revenue Requirements, only 
until such PTO has a full calendar year of cost data under its ownership. Such PTO’s costs will be 
determined from FERC Form 1 data if available, or if not available, from other supporting data 
certified by an auditor.  If the PTO is a public utility, then such other supporting data shall be in a 
format comparable to that used to report such costs in FERC Form 1.   
“Regional Service” as used in this Attachment F means Regional Transmission Service as defined in 
Section I of the Tariff. 
For Public Utility PTOs, depreciation and amortization rates shall be stated values that are approved by 
FERC and displayed in Appendix D to this Attachment.  These stated depreciation and amortization 
rates shall not be changed except pursuant to a limited filing under Federal Power Act (“FPA”) 
Sections 205 or 206.  Subject to the moratorium included herein, any PTO, at its discretion and at a 
 
 
 
 
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2022 - Docket #: ER20-2054-001 
 
time of its choosing, may make a limited filing pursuant to Section 205 to change its stated 
depreciation or amortization rates.  The sole issue in any such limited Section 205 proceeding shall be 
whether such proposed change(s) is (are) just and reasonable, and the proceeding shall not address 
other aspects of the formula rate. 
For Section 201(f) PTOs, depreciation and amortization rates shall be set and revised by the 
appropriate authority acting in accordance with applicable state law and will be displayed in Appendix 
D to this Attachment F. 
The PTOs shall make an annual informational filing subject to the Interim Protocols or Protocols set 
forth in Appendices C1 and C2, respectively.  The filing of the informational filing does not re-open 
the formula rate of Attachment F and its appendices for review, but rather is contestable only in 
accordance with the Interim Protocols and Protocols set forth in Appendices C1 and C2 of this 
Attachment, respectively.   
The following long-standing interpretations of the Attachment F formula rate, which were explained in 
the Interpretative Guidance as to Certain Questions Arising in the Context of the RNS Audit Mandated 
by the Settlement Agreement Reached in the Tariff Docket, which is Appendix D.1 to the RNS Rate 
Audit Report, that was filed with the Commission on April 24, 2002 in Docket No. OA97-237, apply 
to the formula rate set forth in Appendix A, Appendix B, and the Attachments to Appendix B:   
(i)  Use of Costs Assigned to the Transmission Function Rather Than Allocated Costs:  A 
number of the components of the Attachment F formula indicate that allocation factors are to 
be applied to amounts recorded in specific FERC accounts in order to determine the portion of 
such amounts to be applied to transmission.  In lieu of the allocation factors, the PTOs may use 
actual, functional data to determine various components of the Attachment F formula provided 
that the PTOs specifically identify in their FERC Form 1s (or other Applicable Forms for 
Section 201(f) PTOs) the specific instances where actual data is being used in lieu of allocated 
data.   
(ii)  Return on Equity (ROE):  The ROE shall equal the value most recently approved by the 
Commission, except as limited by state law for Section 201(f) PTOs.  
(iii)  Municipal Tax Expense:  Some municipal systems pay property taxes whereas others 
make payments in lieu of taxes, and, in some cases:  (a) the payment in lieu of taxes is related 
to earnings and (b) there is some discretion as to the amount that is paid or transferred to the 
municipality.  Accordingly, a level of property tax may be recognized as an expense with a cap 
 
 
 
 
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2022 - Docket #: ER20-2054-001 
 
based on the local property tax rates applied to the transmission facilities actually owned by 
the municipal utility, provided that the Municipal Transmission Owner is using a traditionally 
accepted or recognized methodology and has adequate and verifiable supporting 
documentation. 
Other than as expressly stated above, no guidance or interpretations that were in the RNS Rate Audit 
Report shall be applicable to Appendix A, Appendix B, and the Attachments to Appendix B of this 
Attachment F. 
Moratorium: 
This Attachment F and its appendices shall be subject to a moratorium on any changes made or 
proposed under Section 205 or Section 206 of the FPA, subject to the exceptions described in the 
“Moratorium Exceptions” section below or as explicitly permitted under the Settlement Agreement 
filed and accepted by the Commission in Docket No. EL16-19-000 (“Settlement Agreement”).  The 
moratorium period shall commence on the earlier of the filing date of the Settlement Agreement with 
the Commission or January 1, 2019, and shall end on December 31, 2024.  Except as permitted by the 
paragraph below or as explicitly permitted under the Settlement Agreement, no person who is a 
signatory to the Settlement Agreement (“Settling Parties”) shall make a Section 205 or Section 206 
filing seeking to change this Attachment F, its appendices or the Protocols before the end of the 
moratorium period on December 31, 2024.  This moratorium shall apply to any and all FERC filings 
seeking to change this Attachment F, its appendices or the Protocols during the moratorium period.  In 
the event that any non-settling party or any other person or entity makes a filing with the FERC prior to 
the end of the moratorium period seeking to modify this Attachment F, its appendices or the Protocols 
that is not specifically permitted by the Settlement Agreement or this Attachment F, and FERC does 
not reject such filing in accordance with this moratorium provision or otherwise, the moratorium 
agreed to hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Settling Parties shall be free to seek changes 
to this Attachment F, its appendices or the Protocols pursuant to Section 205 or Section 206 at any time 
thereafter. 
Moratorium Exceptions: 
(i) 
In addition to any changes to this Attachment F explicitly permitted by any provision of the 
Settlement Agreement, the following filings shall be permitted during the moratorium period; provided 
that, except as specified in subpart (f) below, any such filings shall not open up for review by the 
Commission any other provisions of this Attachment F during the moratorium period.

MMWEC’s Total Transmission Revenue Requirements include only: (1) those PTF costs and Support Payments that are associated with the minority joint ownership share of 11.7711% in the Seabrook 
Switchyard; and (2) Support Payments made by MMWEC with respect to other PTF. The Seabrook-related costs include MMWEC's 11.5934% ownership share and the 0.1777% (total) shares owned 
independently by Hudson and Taunton. MMWEC will distribute the revenue as appropriate among Hudson, Taunton, and the municipal entities that participate in MMWEC's ownership share. Besides 
MMWEC, no municipal joint owner will recover Seabrook Switchyard costs in their revenue requirements.
Total Transmission Revenue Requirements excludes the effects of accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations in accordance with Order No. 631, Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Rate Filing 
Requirements for Asset Retirement Obligations.

(b)
PTF = Pool Transmission Facilities.  PTF Transmission Plant shall equal the PTO’s transmission plant as defined in the Section II.49 of the OATT and determined in accordance with Appendix A 
of this Rule, which is entitled “Rules for Determining Investment To be Included in PTF.”  PTF/HTF Transmission Plant Investment shall equal the PTO’s (a) PTF Transmission Plant plus (b) HTF 
(Highgate Transmission Facilities) Transmission Plant. This value excludes (i) the PTO's Phase I/II HVDC-TF Leases, (ii) the portion of any facilities, the cost of which is directly assigned under 
Schedule 11 to the OATT, to the Transmission Customer or a Generator Owner or Interconnection Requester, (iii) the PTF gross plant investment associated with leased facilities occupied 
by the Phase II section of the Phase I/II HVDC-TF. 
(c)
To the extent balances herein include plant costs of a transmission project that (1) was selected by ISO-NE through a competitive solution process to address a transmission
need pursuant to the procedures in Section II, Attachment K of the ISO New England Tariff, and (2) such selection was based, in part, upon the project’s commitment to cost containment
measures, the PTO will include a separate workpaper with the Annual Update that specifies the plant costs associated with the project and provide a reconciliation to the applicable cost
containment measures.
(d)
Balances as calculated in attachments exclude ARC assets.
(e)
For MMWEC, MMWEC relies on its co-owner's,  New Hampshire Transmission, LLC (NHT), books and records for determining the percentage of its Total Transmission Plant 
In Service that constitutes its Regional Transmission Service Plant.
(f)
For MMWEC, because MMWEC does not recover the cost associated with its Non-PTF Seabrook Switchyard assets pursuant to Schedule 21 or other provisions of the ISO-NE 
Tariff, MMWEC's Local Service Plant is not included in this Attachment F formula rate.
(g)
In addition to Phase I/II HVDC-TF Leases, include on this line the portion of any facilities, the cost of which is directly assigned under Schedule 11 to the OATT, to the Transmission Customer
 or a Generator Owner or Interconnection Requester and the PTF gross plant investment associated with leased facilities occupied by the Phase II section of the Phase I/II HVDC-TF.

or return the under or over recovered amount, with interest. Once the FERC approval of the FPA Section 205 filing is received, this billed or refunded amount will be included in the next transmission 
rate setting process. The NETO will also have the discretion to submit a FPA Section 205 filing to request an adjustment to the fixed PBOP expense amount to more accurately reflect the going forward 
expense level, and to update the fixed PBOP expense level on Appendix A, W/S 4 and Line 4 of this PBOP deferral worksheet.

FERC Account Nos.
20__ Year End Unamortized (Excess)/Deficient ADIT
Amortization Periods (f)
Amortization Expense (d) 
Other Adjustments (e)
20__Year End Unamortized (Excess)/Deficient ADIT
Enter credit balances as negatives.
Upon a change in Federal, State or Local income tax rates, the Company remeasures its affected accumulated deferred income tax (ADIT) assets and liabilities to reflect the new applicable corporate income tax rate.  The affected ADIT accounts are remeasured by comparing ADIT on cumulative temporary differences for each item in accounts 190, 282, and 283 at the current Federal, State & Local income tax rate to ADIT balances at the historical Federal, State & Local income tax rates. The difference between the two represents the deficient or excess ADIT balances.  The result of this remeasurement is a change to the net deferred tax assets/liabilities recorded in accounts 190, 282, and 283 with a corresponding 
net change in regulatory assets (account 182.3) and regulatory liabilities (account 254) to reflect the resulting deficient or excess ADIT balances to be recovered/returned from/to customers, respectively. See Worksheet 10a for additional detail of the remeasurement.
Deficient ADIT is amortized to Account 410.1; Excess ADIT is amortized to Account 411.1 .
PTO will provide explanation  for "other adjustments," where applicable.

Eversource Energy electric utility subsidiaries, CL&P, PSNH and NSTAR West, accounting system accommodates directly assigning costs to the distribution or transmission business segments. Costs are assigned to the 
appropriate business segment through the use of an “Entity” code (previously called a "Charge Accounting Unit”) at the transactional level in the source accounting systems (i.e., payroll system, accounts payable system, 
etc.).  The transmission segment “Entity” codes are identified below:
Unfunded reserves are defined as funds collected from customers in advance of an anticipated expense that (1) have not been set aside in a trust, escrow or restricted account; and (2) whose balance has been collected 
from customers through cost accruals to accounts that are recovered under the Formula Rate, provided that any portion of an unfunded reserve that is paid for by debiting one balance sheet account and crediting another 
balance sheet account will not be deducted from rate base. Further, where a given reserve is only partially funded through accruals collected from customers, only the balance funded by customer collections shall serve as 
a rate base credit.  The FERC account number is dependent on the unfunded reserve that is established. The unfunded reserve will be allocated to the Transmission function utilizing the same allocator used in the Formula 
Rate for the cost accruals to the account that is recovered under the Formula Rate. Support for the unfunded reserves credit to rate base will be included in the annual update informational filing.

ATTACHMENT F – APPENDIX E 
 
RULES FOR DETERMINING INVESTMENT TO BE INCLUDED IN PTF 
 
Section A – Transmission Lines* 
Section B – Terminal Facilities* 
Section C – Right of Way* 
*The following provision shall apply to Sections A, B and C below: 
Of those transmission facilities that are upgrades, modifications or additions to the New England 
Transmission System on and after January 1, 2004, only those that: (i) are rated 115kV or above, 
and (ii) otherwise meet the non-voltage criteria specified in Section II.49 of this OATT shall be 
classified as PTF. Those transmission facilities that were PTF on December 31, 2003, and any 
upgrades to such facilities that meet the definition of PTF specified in this OATT, shall remain 
classified as PTF for all purposes under the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff. 
Section A: Rules for Determining Transmission Line Investment to be Included in PTF 
Pool Transmission Facilities (PTF) are the transmission facilities owned by PTO rated 69 kV or 
above required to allow energy from significant power sources to move freely on the New England 
transmission network, and include: 
1. 
All transmission lines and associated facilities owned by the PTOs rated 69 kV and above, 
except: 
a. 
those which are required to serve local load only, thereby contributing little or no 
parallel capability to the transmission network, 
b.  
generator leads, which are defined as the radial transmission from a generator bus to 
the nearest point on the transmission network, 
c. 
lines that are normally operated open. 
d. 
those that are classified as MTF. 
2. 
Terminal facilities (including substation facilities such as transformers, circuit breakers, and 
associated equipment) required to interconnect the lines which constitute PTF (see Section 
B). 
3. 
If a PTO with significant generation in its system (initially 25 MW) is connected to the New 
England Transmission System and none of the transmission facilities owned by the PTO 
qualify to be included in PTF as defined in “1” and “2” above, then such PTO’s connection 
to PTF will constitute PTF if both of the following requirements are met for this connection: 
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2022 - Docket #: ER20-2054-001 
 
a. 
The connection is rated 69 kV or above. 
b. 
The connection is the principal transmission link between the PTO and the 
remainder of the ISO PTF network. 
The PTF facilities covered by this provision shall consist of a single line from the point of 
connection on the transmission network to the first bus within the PTO’s system. 
4. 
R/W and land required for the installation of PTF facilities listed in “1”, “2”, or “3” (see 
Section C). 
The following examples indicate the intent of the above definitions: 
a. 
Radial tap lines to local load are excluded. 
b. 
Lines which loop, from two geographically separate points on the transmission 
network, the supply to the load bus from the transmission network are included. 
c. 
Lines which loop, from two geographically separate points on the transmission 
network, the connections between a generator bus, and the transmission network are 
included. 
d. 
Radial connection or connections from a generating station to a single substation or 
switching station on the transmission network are excluded unless the requirements 
of paragraph 3 above are met. 
e. 
The cost of a PTF line will include only those costs associated with that line. When 
other facilities require rebuilding or undergrounding to permit the construction of a 
PTF facility, the investment costs in the relocated or undergrounded facility will not 
be included. 
f. 
Where multiple circuit structures support a mixture of PTF and Non-PTF circuits, 
the total cost of the multiple circuit structures will be allocated between the circuits 
in accordance with the ratio of costs of comparable individual structures. 
g. 
Transmission lines and equipment that loop with external ties are included. 
The PTOs shall review at least annually the status of transmission lines and related facilities 
and determine whether such facilities constitute PTF and shall prepare and keep current a 
schedule or catalog of PTF facilities. 
All new facilities being installed should be properly classified at the time the facilities are 
approved under Section I.3.9 of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff. 
Transmission facilities owned or supported by a Related Person of a PTO which are rated 
69 kV or above and are required to allow Energy from significant power sources to move 
freely on the New England Transmission System shall also constitute PTF provided (i) such 
Related Person files with the ISO its consent to such treatment; and (ii) the ISO determines 
in consultation with the PTO Administrative Committee that treatment of the facility as PTF 
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2022 - Docket #: ER20-2054-001 
 
will facilitate accomplishment of the ISO’s objectives. If such facilities constitute PTF 
pursuant to this paragraph, they shall be treated as “owned” or “supported,” as applicable, 
by a PTO for purposes of the OATT and the other provisions of the TOA, including the 
ability to include the cost associated with such PTF and any Transmission Support 
Expenses for support of PTF made by its Related Person in that PTO’s Annual 
Transmission Revenue Requirements pursuant to Attachment F of the OATT. 
Section B: Rules for Determining Terminal Investment to be Included in PTF 
Terminal Investment is investment associated with the terminal facilities of electrical lines, 
including substation facilities such as transformers, circuit breakers, disconnects and airbreaks, bus 
conductor, related protection equipment and other related facilities (see paragraph 7). 
1. 
The investment in terminal facilities shall be included where these facilities are identifiable 
and serve directly for terminating and/or switching PTF lines. 
2. 
In cases where a line terminal is used in conjunction with both PTF and Non-PTF lines 
and/or facilities, it will be considered a PTF facility providing the terminal facility is at 69 
kV or above and carries any power flow at 69 kV or above through parallel paths within the 
interconnected network under normal operation. PTF equipment is any element of the 
transmission system in those parallel paths. Any equipment not in these parallel paths is 
Non-PTF. 
3. 
Where line terminals are installed solely for Non-PTF facilities, and do not carry any power 
flow at 69 kV or above through parallel paths within the interconnected network under 
normal operation, such terminal cost shall not be included in PTF. 
4. 
A two-winding transformer which connects PTF facilities at both terminals along with any 
switcher which can be identified as pertaining solely to the transformer, will be included in 
their entirety as PTF. 
5. 
An autotransformer or three winding transformer which connects PTF facilities at two (2) or 
more terminals, along with any switchgear which can be identified as pertaining solely to 
the PTF-connected terminals of the transformer, will be included in their entirety as PTF. 
An autotransformer or three winding transformer which is connected to PTF at only one 
terminal will not be PTF. 
6. 
When a transformer supplies only Non-PTF facilities, the entire transformer installation, 
including the high side disconnect switch or circuit breaker and associated structures or tap 
lines shall be excluded from PTF except for the portion of line terminal facilities covered by 
paragraph 2. 
7. 
Other facilities – the investment in that portion of a multi-use substation or switching station 
which is identifiable as serving a PTF function shall be included in PTF, while the 
investment in such facilities which are identifiable as serving a Non-PTF function shall be 
excluded. The investment in land, structures, ground mats, fences, ducts, lighting, etc., can 
often be identified and thus allocated. The investment in other facilities in the substation or 
switching station, excluding transformers, which are not identifiable as serving either a PTF 
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2022 - Docket #: ER20-2054-001 
 
or a Non-PTF function and general overheads shall be allocated to PTF on the basis of the 
ratio of the investment in those facilities identified as PTF to the sum of the investments in 
the facilities which are identified as serving PTF and Non-PTF functions; the equipment 
cost of power transformers shall not be included in this calculation for determining the 
division of investment, since this would produce a distorted balance. 
8. 
Alternate method of allocating the cost of terminal facilities – In those cases where the 
major portion of the investment has been lumped and utility plant records do not permit the 
accurate assignment of costs to specific terminals, the total investment may be prorated to 
PTF and Non-PTF according to the number of terminals serving PTF and Non-PTF 
facilities. 
9. 
In cases where microwave facilities are used in whole or part for PTF purposes, a prorated 
portion of such investment shall be included in PTF based on the PTF and Non-PTF 
functions served by the microwave facilities except where these facilities are otherwise 
supported under the Microwave Sharing Agreement dated June 1, 1970 among some of the 
New England utilities. 
10. 
Generator unit transformers and generator circuit breakers shall be excluded from PTF, 
unless otherwise included by paragraphs 1 or 5. 
11. 
In cases where remote control (Supervisory Control) and telemetering facilities are used in 
whole or in part for PTF purposes, a prorated portion of such investment shall be included 
in PTF based on the PTF and Non-PTF functions served by these facilities. 
12. 
The PTO Administrative Committee may designate appropriate facilities as PTF. 
13. 
Flow limiting reactors, if operated normally bypassed, but capable of automatic insertion in 
a line to control flows in PTF facilities under certain operating conditions, shall be included 
in PTF. 
14. 
Transmission level capacitor banks connected to a PTF eligible bus that may be normally 
operated open, but capable of being placed in service during adverse system events, shall be 
included in PTF. 
15. 
Transmission level capacitor banks that are connected by the PTF by radial lines shall not 
be included in PTF. 
16. 
Transformer-related costs, such as installation and other related costs that would not have 
been incurred but for the transformer, shall be treated in the same manner as the costs of the 
transformer.   
 
Section C: Rules for Determining PTF R/W Costs 
1. 
If a R/W has only PTF lines and no Non-PTF lines are expected to be added, the entire cost 
of the R/W is to be included as PTF. 
 
Effective Date: 1/1/2022 - Docket #: ER20-2054-001 
 
2. 
If the R/W has only PTF lines but includes additional unused R/W which was purchased for 
future use by Non-PTF lines, the cost of the additional R/W is not to be included as PTF. 
3. 
If the R/W contains both PTF and Non-PTF lines, the R/W cost to be assigned to PTF is to 
be determined as follows: 
a. 
Where new or additional R/W is required to permit the construction of PTF line(s) 
and the added R/W is adequate to contain the new PTF, the cost of the new R/W is 
to be assigned to the PTF line(s), (even if the PTF line is located on the old R/W). 
b. 
Where an existing R/W is used (without additional R/W), the amount allocated to 
PTF will be determined in accordance with paragraph 4. 
c. 
Where a R/W is widened, but the new facilities, either PTF or Non-PTF, require 
partial use of the existing R/W, the incremental cost of the new R/W will be 
assigned to the new facilities. The width of the original R/W will be added to the 
width of the new R/W and the combined width will be allocated between PTF and 
Non-PTF as in paragraph 4. The cost of the old R/W and the combined width will 
be allocated between PTF and Non-PTF as in paragraph 4. The cost of the old R/W 
will be allocated to the new facilities in proportion to the width of the old R/W 
assigned to the new facilities. Thus, the R/W for the new facilities will be the 
additional R/W plus a share of the old R/W. 
4. 
In allocating R/W between PTF and Non-PTF lines, each shall bear a share of the R/W in 
accordance with the following formulae. 
a. 
Determine the R/W width required for each facility if constructed independently 
using appropriate type structures. 
b. 
Allocate the actual R/W width to each facility in the proportion its independent 
R/W requirement would be to the sum of the independent R/W requirements. 
5. 
R/W and land held for future PTF facilities may be included in PTF facilities only if 
specifically approved by the PTO Administrative Committee included under paragraph 1.

ATTACHMENT I 
SYSTEM IMPACT STUDY AGREEMENT 
 
This SYSTEM IMPACT STUDY AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”), dated ___________, is entered into 
by ___________ (the “Customer “) and ISO New England Inc. (“ISO”), for the purpose of setting forth the 
terms, conditions and costs for conducting a System Impact Study (the “Study”) relative to [the 
interconnection to the New England Transmission System of the Customer’s proposed _______ project (the 
“Project”) to be located in _______, _______,] [or] [the provision of transmission service requested in the 
Customer’s Application] in accordance with the Open Access Transmission Tariff (the “OATT”) included 
in the ISO Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (“Commission”). The ISO and the Customer are sometimes referred to herein together as the 
“Parties” and individually as a “Party.”  
 
1.  
Information Requirements  
The Customer agrees to provide, in a timely and complete manner and in accordance with the ISO New 
England Planning Procedures, the information and technical data specified in Exhibit 1 to this Agreement 
for the ISO to conduct the Study. The Customer understands that it must provide all such information and 
data prior to the ISO’s commencement of the Study. The ISO will advise the Customer of any additional 
information as it may in its sole reasonable discretion deem necessary to complete the Study. Any such 
additional information shall be obtained only if required by Good Utility Practice and shall be subject to the 
Customer’s consent to proceed, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  
 
2.  
Representatives  
All work pertaining to the Study that is the subject of this Agreement will be approved and coordinated only 
through designated and authorized representatives of the Customer and the ISO, as they are identified in 
Article 12.5 hereof.  
 
3.  
Duration and Results of Study  
The ISO contemplates that its subcontractors and agents will require _____________ to complete the 
Study, as more fully set forth in Exhibit 2, entitled “Study Timetable.” The Customer understands and 
agrees that such time periods are only an estimate and that the ISO makes no representations or warranties, 
either express or implied, that the Study will be completed within these time periods. Upon completion of 
the Study, the ISO will provide a report to the Customer based on the information provided and developed 
 
 
as a result of this effort. If, upon review of the Study results and in accordance with the ISO New England 
Planning Procedures, the Customer decides to pursue interconnection, the ISO will, at the Customer’s 
direction, tender a Facilities Study Agreement within thirty (30) days or other period as specified in the ISO 
New England Planning Procedures. The Study and the Facilities Study, together with any additional studies 
contemplated in Paragraph 1, shall form the basis for the Customer’s proposed use of the relevant 
transmission system and shall be further utilized in obtaining necessary third-party approvals of any 
interconnection facilities and requested interconnection. The Customer understands and acknowledges that 
any use of the Study results by the Customer or its agents, whether in preliminary or final form, prior to the 
ISO’s approval pursuant to Sections I.3.9 and I.3.10 of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff is 
completely at the Customer’s sole risk.  
 
4. Payment and Nature of Costs  
(a) 
The estimated costs contained within this Agreement are the ISO’s good faith estimate of its costs 
to perform the Study contemplated by this Agreement. The estimates do not include any estimates 
for wheeling charges that may be associated with the transmission of facility output to third parties 
or with rates for station service. The actual costs charged to the Customer by the ISO may change as 
set forth in this Agreement. Prepayment will be required for all costs and expenses (including, 
without limitation, labor, materials, overheads, and administrative and general costs) the ISO will 
incur to perform its obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, all study, 
analysis, design, monitoring, and review work performed by the ISO or its designated agent’s 
personnel under the terms of this Agreement (“Study Costs”).  
 
(b)  
The estimated Study Costs required to be paid by the Customer to the ISO are shown on Exhibit 3, 
entitled “Prepayment Schedule.” The initial prepayment requirement is ________________ 
($____), which the Customer agrees to pay to the ISO upon execution of this Agreement. The 
initial prepayment and any subsequent prepayments will be applied against all Study Costs incurred 
by the ISO for work performed under this Agreement. The ISO will invoice the Customer for the 
costs and expenses that the ISO will incur as stated in Exhibit 3. Each invoice will show the detail 
of the work performed, the difference between the actual costs for such work and the prepayment 
amount for such work, and the amount of the prepayment for the costs of expected work. The 
Customer shall pay the invoiced amount to the ISO within thirty (30) days of the Customer’s 
receipt of the ISO’s invoice. During the term of this Agreement, the ISO will, in writing, advise the 
Customer in advance of any cost increases for work to be performed if the total amount increases 
by ten percent (10%) or more. Any such changes to the ISO’s costs for the Study work shall be 
 
 
subject to the Customer’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Customer 
shall, within thirty (30) days of the ISO’s notice of increase, either authorize such increases and 
make payment in the amount set forth in such notice, or the ISO will suspend the Study and may 
terminate this Agreement. Any additional billings under this Agreement shall be subject to an 
interest charge computed in accordance with the provisions of the OATT. Prepayments for work 
expected to be performed shall not be subject to refunding except in accordance with Paragraph 
4(d) below.  
 
(c)  
The ISO will invoice Customer for pre-contract Study Costs incurred by the ISO prior to the 
effective date of this Agreement. To the extent such pre-contract Study Costs exceed Customer’s 
pre-contract cost deposit balance, the Customer will reimburse the ISO within twenty (20) days 
after receipt of the ISO’s invoice. Pre-contract costs shall include, without limitation, costs for 
study, analysis and review work performed in connection with the Study and all costs associated 
with the development and negotiation of all associated agreements. Payment for pre-contract Study 
Costs shall not be subject to refunding to the Customer.  
 
(d)  
If the actual Study Costs for the work exceed prepaid estimated costs, the Customer shall make 
payment to the ISO for such actual Study Costs within thirty (30) days of the date of the ISO’s 
invoice for such costs. If the actual Study Costs for the work are less than those prepaid, the ISO 
will credit such difference toward the ISO’s expected additional costs, or, in the event there will be 
no additional billed expenses, the amount of the overpayment will be returned to the Customer with 
interest computed as stated in Paragraph 4(b) of this Agreement, from the date of reconciliation.  
 
(e)  
Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to give the Customer immediate rights to wheel over 
or interconnect with any transmission or distribution system. Such rights shall be provided for 
under separate agreement and in accordance with the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
(f)  
Within one (1) year following the ISO’s issuance of a final bill under this Agreement, the Customer 
shall have the right to audit the ISO’s accounts and records at the offices where such accounts and 
records are maintained, during normal business hours; provided that appropriate notice shall be 
given prior to any audit and provided that the audit shall be limited to those portions of such 
accounts and records that relate to service under this Agreement. The ISO reserves the right to 
assess a reasonable fee to compensate for the use of its personnel time in assisting any inspection or 
audit of its books, records or accounts by the Customer or its agents.  
 
 
 
5.  
Indemnification  
The indemnification and liability provisions in Section I of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff 
are incorporated herein by reference, with the “Customer” under this Agreement being deemed a Customer 
for purposes of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
6.  
Disclaimer of Damages  
NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF USE OR LOST BUSINESS, REVENUE, PROFITS 
OR GOODWILL, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE STUDY PROVIDED 
HEREUNDER, AND/OR THE INTENDED USE THEREOF, UNDER ANY THEORY OF TORT, 
CONTRACT, WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY OR NEGLIGENCE. The Parties agree this Section 6 
will survive expiration, cancellation, or any termination of the Agreement.  
 
7.  
Duration  
This Agreement will remain in effect for a period of one (1) year from its effective date (the “Term”) and is 
subject to extension automatically to the extent the Study is not complete or by mutual agreement of the 
parties.  
 
8.  
Termination  
(a)  
In addition to other termination provisions provided for herein, the ISO may terminate this 
Agreement immediately, upon notice to the Customer, if the ISO is unable to obtain or maintain 
any governmental license, waiver, consent, registration or approval needed to conduct the Study 
hereunder.  
 
(b)  
The ISO or the Customer may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the 
other party or seven (7) days after providing written notice to the other party that it has breached 
one it its obligations hereunder, if the breach has not been cured within such seven day period.  
 
(c)  
If not terminated pursuant to (a) or (b) above, this Agreement will automatically terminate (except 
for Section 11 hereof) upon the later of the delivery to the Customer of the final Study report and 
receipt by the ISO of final payment from the Customer.  
 
 
 
9.  
Dispute Resolution and Voluntary Arbitration  
The dispute resolution provisions of Section I of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff are 
incorporated herein by reference, with the “Customer” under this Agreement being deemed a Customer for 
purposes of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
10.  
Commission Jurisdiction Over Certain Disputes; Equitable Relief  
(a)  
Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude, or be construed to preclude, any Party from filing a 
petition or complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with respect to any matter 
over which the Commission has jurisdiction.  
 
(b)  
The Parties specifically reserve the right to seek a temporary restraining order, preliminary or 
permanent injunction, or other similar equitable relief with respect to (i) violations of 
confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, (ii) any failures by the parties to comply with any 
applicable post-termination obligations for which monetary compensation would not be adequate, 
or (iii) to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm.  
 
11.  
Confidential Information  
(a)  
During and after the term of this Agreement, neither party or its employees or agents shall divulge 
or use for any purpose other than as specified in this Agreement Confidential Information received 
from the other party (the “Disclosing Party”). “Confidential Information” shall mean all of the 
following except to the extent excluded below: (i) all information about the Disclosing Party 
whether furnished before or after the date hereof, whether oral, written or recorded/electronic, and 
regardless of the manner in which it is furnished, which is marked “Confidential” or “Proprietary” 
or which under all of the circumstances should be treated as confidential or proprietary; (ii) all 
reports, summaries, compilations, analyses, notes or other information which are based on, contain

defined in the ISO New England Information Policy; and (iv) any information which, if disclosed 
by a transmission function employee of a utility regulated by the Commission to a market function 
employee of the same utility system, other than by public posting, would violate the Commission’s 
open access same time information regulations.  
 
(b)  
The foregoing restrictions on use and disclosure of Confidential Information do not apply to 
information that: (i) is already in the possession of the party receiving the information (the 
“Receiving Party”) at the time of the information’s disclosure hereunder and not otherwise subject 
 
 
to obligations of confidentiality; (ii) is, or becomes publicly known, through no wrongful act or 
omission of the Receiving Party or breach of this Agreement; (iii) is received by the Receiving 
Party without restriction from a third party free to disclose it without obligation to the Disclosing 
Party; (iv) is developed independently by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential 
Information or other information of the Disclosing Party; or (v) is required to be disclosed by 
subpoena, law or other directive or a court, administrative agency or arbitration panel. In addition, 
nothing in this Section 11 shall prohibit the Customer from disclosing Confidential Information to 
its lenders, consultants, agents, directors, officers, employees, and attorneys (the 
“Representatives”) for the purpose of advising the Customer with respect to the project, provided 
that the Representatives shall be informed by the Customer that such information is Confidential 
Information and shall agree to treat it confidentially in accordance with this Section 11.  
 
(c)  
At the Disclosing Party’s option, the Receiving Party shall promptly either destroy all Confidential 
Information in tangible form in its possession, or return all such copies, and in either event, provide 
a written officer’s certification confirming the same promptly upon the earlier of: (i) the Disclosing 
Party’s written request; or (ii) the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.  
 
12. Miscellaneous  
12.1  
Assignment. The Customer may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations 
hereunder without the prior written consent of the ISO, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

FACILITIES STUDY AGREEMENT 
 
This Facilities Study Agreement (“Agreement”), dated ______________, 200_, is entered into by 
_________ (the “Customer”) and ISO New England Inc. (“ISO”) for the purpose of setting forth the terms, 
conditions, and costs for conducting a Facilities Study (the “Study”) on [both] the systems of _________  
[and] _________ (“the Transmission Operator(s)”) relative to [the Customer’s proposed _______ project 
(the “Project”) to be located in _______, _______,] [or] [the transmission service requested in the 
Customer’s Application] in accordance with the Open Access Transmission Tariff (the “OATT”) included 
in the ISO Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission.  The ISO and the Customer are sometimes referred to herein together as the “Parties” and 
individually as a “Party.”  
 
1.  
Purposes and Elements of the Study  
The Study will determine the detailed engineering, design and cost of the facilities, upgrades, and special 
protection systems necessary to [satisfy the Customer’s interconnection for the Project] [or] [provide the 
transmission service] as indicated by the System Impact Study (the “SIS”).  
 
2.  
Information Requirements  
The Customer agrees to provide, in a timely and complete manner, all required information and technical 
data necessary for the ISO or its designated agent to conduct the Study. Where such information and 
technical data were previously provided by the Customer for purposes of the SIS, or otherwise, the 
Customer should review and update the information and provide the ISO with current information, as 
required.  The ISO will advise the Customer of additional information or studies that may be deemed 
necessary to complete the Study.  Any such additional information or studies shall be obtained or 
conducted only if required by Good Utility Practice and shall be subject to the Customer’s consent to 
proceed, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The cost of such additional studies shall be paid for 
by the Customer.  
 
3.  
Representatives  
All work pertaining to the Study that is the subject of this Agreement will be approved only through 
designated and authorized representatives of the Customer and the ISO, as they are identified in Article 14.5 
hereof.  
 
 
 
4.  
Scope, Duration, and Results of Study  
The Scope of Work for the Study is set forth in Exhibit 1, entitled “Scope of Work.” The ISO estimates that 
the Study will require approximately ______ (__) [time period] to complete, as more fully set forth in 
Exhibit 2, entitled “Study Timetable.” The Customer understands and agrees that such time periods are only 
an estimate and that the ISO makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, that the 
Study will be completed within these time periods. The ISO will provide the Customer with periodic status 
reports, which describe preliminary Study results, if available. Upon completion of the Study, the ISO will 
provide a report on the Study to the Customer based on the information provided and developed as a result 
of this effort. The Customer understands and acknowledges that any use of the Study results by the 
Customer or its agents, whether in preliminary or final form, prior to the ISO’s approval pursuant to 
Sections I.3.9 and I.3.10 of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff is completely at the Customer’s 
sole risk.  
 
5.  
Payment and Nature of Costs  
(a)  
The estimated costs contained within this Agreement are the ISO’s good faith estimate of 
its costs to perform the Study contemplated by this Agreement. The ISO does not include 
any estimates for wheeling charges that may be associated with the transmission of facility 
output to third parties or with rates for station service. The actual costs charged to the 
Customer by the ISO may change as set forth in this Agreement. Prepayment will be 
required for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, labor, materials, 
overheads, and administrative and general costs) the ISO will incur to perform its 
obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, all study, analysis, design, 
monitoring, and review work performed by the ISO or its designated agent’s personnel 
under the terms of this Agreement (“Study Costs”).  
 
(b)  
The estimated Study Costs required to be paid by the Customer to the ISO are shown on 
Exhibit 3, entitled “Prepayment Schedule.” The initial prepayment requirement is 
________________ ($____), which the Customer agrees to pay to the ISO upon execution 
of this Agreement. The initial prepayment and any subsequent prepayments will be applied 
against all Study Costs incurred by the ISO for work performed under this Agreement. The 
ISO will invoice the Customer for the costs and expenses that the ISO will incur as stated in 
Exhibit 3. Each invoice will show the detail of the work performed, the difference between 
the actual costs for such work and the prepayment amount for such work, and the amount 
of the prepayment for the costs of the expected work. The Customer shall pay the invoiced 
 
 
amount to the ISO within thirty (30) days of the Customer’s receipt of the ISO’s invoice. 
During the term of this Agreement, the ISO will, in writing, advise the Customer in 
advance of any changes in the cost estimate for work to be performed if the total amount 
increases by ten percent (10%) or more. Any such change to the Study Costs for the ISO’s 
work performed under this Agreement shall be subject to the Customer’s consent, such 
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Customer shall, within thirty (30) days of the 
ISO’s notice of a cost increase, either authorize such cost increase and make payment in the 
amount set forth in such notice, or the ISO will suspend its performance and may terminate 
this Agreement. Payments for work performed by the ISO shall not be subject to refunding 
to the Customer except in accordance with Section 5(d) below.  
 
(c)  
The ISO will invoice Customer for pre-contract Study Costs incurred by the ISO prior to 
the effective date of this Agreement. To the extent such pre-contract Study Costs exceed 
Customer’s pre-contract cost deposit balance, the Customer will reimburse the ISO within 
twenty (20) days after receipt of the ISO’s invoice. Pre-contract costs shall include, without 
limitation, costs for study, analysis and review work performed in connection with the 
Study and all costs associated with the development and negotiation of all associated 
agreements. Payment for pre-contract Study Costs shall not be subject to refunding to the 
Customer.  
 
(d)  
If the actual Study Costs for the work exceed prepaid estimated costs, the Customer shall 
make payment to the ISO for such actual Study Costs within thirty (30) days of the date of 
the invoice for such costs. If the actual costs for the work are less than that prepaid, the ISO 
will credit such difference toward its expected additional costs, or in the event there will be 
no additional billed costs, will refund to Customer the amount of the overpayment. Any 
additional payments or refunding under this Agreement shall be subject to an interest 
charge computed in accordance with the provisions of the OATT.  
 
(e)  
Within one (1) year following the issuance of a final bill under this Agreement, the 
Customer shall have the right to audit the ISO’s accounts and records at the offices where 
such accounts and records are maintained during normal business hours; provided that 
appropriate notice shall have been given prior to any audit and provided that the audit shall 
be limited to those portions of such accounts and records that relate to service under this 
Agreement. The ISO reserves the right to assess a reasonable fee to compensate for the use 
 
 
of its personnel’s time in assisting any inspection or audit of its books, records or accounts 
by the Customer or its designated agent.  
 
6.  
No Interconnection or Wheeling Rights; No Interruption of Service  
 
(a)  
Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to give the Customer the right to have 
electricity wheeled over, or to interconnect with, the ISO’s or the Transmission Operator’s 
transmission or distribution system. Such rights may be provided for under separate 
agreement.  
 
(b)  
Before the ISO will take any portion of the transmission system out of service to 
accommodate any work by, or on behalf of, the Customer, such action must first be fully 
evaluated and approved by the ISO and the Transmission Operator.  
 
7.  
Indemnification  
The indemnification and liability provisions in Section I of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff 
are incorporated herein by reference, with the “Customer” under this Agreement being deemed a Customer

ATTACHMENT M 
ROLE OF INDEPENDENT TRANSMISSION COMPANIES 
This Attachment sets forth a general framework for the development and operation of Independent 
Transmission Companies (“ITC’s”) within the ISO, pursuant to the process set forth herein. Certain 
responsibilities specified in this Attachment may be assigned to an ITC, if the ITC chooses to accept those 
responsibilities and if the Commission’s acceptance or approval of the assignment of those responsibilities 
to the ITC, including a determination of the capability of the ITC to carry out those responsibilities, is 
obtained as provided herein.   
This Attachment governs the rights, responsibilities, and functions of the ITC and the relationship between 
the ISO and the ITC, which shall be set forth in greater detail and on a binding basis in an agreement 
between the ISO and the ITC governing the allocation of responsibilities between such ITC and the ISO and 
other matters necessary for the coordinated operation of the ITC and the ISO (an “ITC Agreement”).  Any 
modifications to the rights, responsibilities and functions of PTOs under the TOA shall not affect the rights, 
responsibilities and functions of the ITC under this Attachment or an executed and effective ITC 
Agreement, unless this Attachment or such ITC Agreement, respectively, is similarly modified.  To the 
extent that the rights and responsibilities of an ITC with respect to a particular function or subject matter are 
not described in this Attachment (or an ITC Agreement developed pursuant to the process described in this 
Attachment) in a manner different in substance from the TOA’s description of the rights and 
responsibilities of a PTO with respect to that particular function or subject matter, then:  (x) an ITC shall 
have the same rights and responsibilities as a PTO under the TOA, (y) the rights and responsibilities of the 
ISO shall be the same in relation to an ITC as to a PTO under the TOA, and (z) the terms and conditions of 
the TOA shall govern the relationship between the ITC and the ISO and shall be given effect in the ITC 
Agreement.  Nothing in this Attachment shall modify the relationship between the ISO and any PTO that 
has not agreed to transfer operational authority or ownership of its transmission facilities to the ITC, or the 
rights, responsibilities and functions of such PTO under the TOA.  Unless otherwise defined herein, all 
capitalized terms used in this Attachment are used as defined in the Tariff.  
Any PTO or PTOs desiring to participate in, join, or become an ITC shall provide notice to the ISO that they 
desire to commence negotiation of an ITC Agreement.  Such notice shall be accompanied by a resolution 
of the Board of Directors of each such PTO or a letter executed by the chief executive officer or senior 
officer of each such PTO indicating a commitment to participate in, join, or become an ITC. The ISO and 
the PTO(s) desiring to participate in, join or become an ITC shall negotiate in good faith over the terms of 
 
 
an IC Agreement. This Attachment shall constitute the framework for those negotiations, provided that the 
ISO and the PTO(s) proposing to participate in, join, or become an ITC may agree that such ITC may 
assume additional or fewer rights or responsibilities, provided that the ITC’s assumption of additional or 
fewer rights or responsibilities does not adversely affect any other PTO. If the ISO and the negotiating 
PTO(s) reach agreement on the terms of an ITC Agreement, the ISO and the negotiating PTO(s) shall 
jointly file the ITC Agreement with the Commission under Section 205. If the ISO and the negotiating 
PTO(s) are unable to reach agreement on the terms of an ITC Agreement within one hundred and twenty 
(120) days, or such shorter or longer period as they may mutually agree, the ISO and the negotiating PTO(s) 
shall jointly file a proposed ITC Agreement with the Commission under Section 205, showing their 
respective positions on any provisions (including those that specify the ISO or ITC rights and 
responsibilities) with respect to which they disagree. The Commission’s resolution of any such 
disagreements shall establish the terms upon which such ITC may be established, if the negotiating PTO(s) 
decide to proceed with the establishment of an ITC. The negotiating PTO(s) may elect to proceed with the 
establishment of an ITC, and the ISO may execute or implement an ITC Agreement, without foregoing the 
right to seek appellate review by courts of competent jurisdiction of any condition established or ruling 
made by the Commission or any other governmental Authority.  
 
Any pro forma ITC Agreement filed by the ISO with the Commission to become effective on or after the 
Operations Date shall be the starting point for any negotiations commenced thereafter between the ISO and 
any PTO(s) and shall be based on and consistent with the allocation of rights and responsibilities and other 
provisions contained in this Attachment. If this Attachment is change after a pro forma ITC Agreement has 
been filed with the Commission, such pro forma ITC Agreement shall be modified to conform to any 
subsequent changes to this Attachment.  
 
1.  
COMMISSION APPROVAL  
In order for an ITC to assume rights, responsibilities and functions specified in this Attachment, the PTO(s) 
that are proposing to participate in, join, or become an  
 
ITC must apply for, and receive, a Commission order finding that: (1) the proposed ITC satisfies the 
Commission’s independence criteria; (2) the ITC has the necessary capabilities to carry out the 
responsibilities and functions, and (3) the ITC meets any other applicable Commission criteria. The ISO 
(except to the extent the ISO reaches agreement with the PTO(s) that are proposing to participate in, join, or 
become the ITC on the foregoing items) and others shall have the rights to intervene, comment, or protest 
 
 
any such filing or to file a complaint under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act with regard to any such 
ITC filing or document.  
 
Once the Commission issues an order accepting the filing and providing the finding required under this 
Section 1, then the ITC may operate within the ISO consistent with the rights, responsibilities, and 
functions that have been accepted or approved by the Commission. In addition, the TOA shall be 
superseded or amended with respect to any PTO whose transmission facilities are owned or operated by the 
approved ITC, and the ITC shall enter into an ITC Agreement with the ISO, consistent with Section 10.05 
of the TOA and this Attachment, as appropriate to reflect the assumption of rights, functions and 
responsibilities by the ITC and the ISO’s Operational Authority for such transmission facilities.  
 
2.  
RELIABILITY COORDINATION  
2.1  
Regional Reliability Authority. The ISO shall be the regional Reliability Authority for the New 
England Transmission System, including any ITC transmission systems. The ISO shall be responsible for 
system reliability and operation of the New England Markets. As the Reliability Authority, the ISO is 
responsible for ensuring the reliability of the bulk power transmission system in the Region. Certain 
functions may be performed by an ITC in coordination with the ISO and subject to the ultimate authority of 
the ISO as the Reliability Authority.  
 
2.2  
Security Analysis and Real-Time Monitoring. The ISO shall perform real-time monitoring and 
security assessment of the New England Transmission System. An ITC may perform security analysis and 
real-time monitoring of the ITC System. As to each ITC, the “ITC System” shall consist of all transmission 
facilities owned or operated by the ITC and all generation and loads interconnected to such transmission 
facilities either directly or through one or more sub-transmission and/or distribution facilities directly 
interconnected to such transmission facilities.  
 
2.3  
ITC Actions. An ITC may take actions to preserve the security of the ITC System, including but not 
limited to voltage management, the determination of active and passive transmission device settings, 
changes in topology, outage management, and other operating actions affecting the ITC transmission 
system, in accordance with applicable ISO New England Operating Procedures pursuant to Section 15 of 
this Attachment.  
 
2.4  
Ultimate Authority. The ISO may intercede and direct appropriate near-term operational actions in 
its role as regional Reliability Authority, provided that nothing in this Section 2.4 shall require any ITC to 
 
 
undertake an action contrary to applicable Law or shall limit the right of the ITC to adopt and implement, 
consistent with Good Utility Practice, procedures and to take such actions it deems necessary to protect its 
facilities from physical damage or to prevent injury or damage to persons or property. If such ISO action is 
disputed, the ISO’s position shall control pending resolution of the dispute.  
 
2.5  
Information. The ISO and the ITC shall share information to enable them to perform their 
respective functions in accordance with Section 17 of this Attachment.  
 
3.  
TRANSMISSION RATES  
3.1  
Right to File Rate Changes and ITC Rate Schedules. The ITC shall possess the unilateral right, 
without receiving any ISO approval, to make filings at the Commission pursuant to FPA Section 205 
proposing rate or rate structure changes (including incentive rate structures related to Section 5.2 of this 
Attachment or other incentive or performance-based rate structures) involving transmission charges for 
service to load within the ITC System, provided that: (a) the ITC shall consult with the ISO and the PTO AC 
at least thirty days prior to submitting any such filing to the Commission; (b) no such rate or rate structure 
changes shall abridge the rights granted to the ISO in Section 3.04(c) of the TOA, reserved in Section 3.14 
of the TOA, or reflected in this Attachment; and (c) if the ISO identifies to the ITC any concerns relating to 
the modification of software necessary to implement any such rate or rate structure change, the ITC shall so 
indicate in its filing, the ISO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement any software 
modifications by the effective date of the ITC’s filing, and any failure to complete the modifications by 
such date, notwithstanding commercially reasonable efforts, shall not constitute a default by the ISO or a 
basis for financial damages and the ISO shall, if necessary, run retroactive settlements consistent with such 
effective date. Such rate or rate structure changes shall be included in discrete schedules or portions of the 
OATT (hereafter, such discrete schedules or portions of the OATT shall be the “ITC Rate Schedule”). In its 
filing with the Commission, the ITC shall comply with all applicable Commission requirements. The ITC 
shall also include in any filing a statement that, in the good faith judgment of the ITC, the proposal will not 
be inconsistent with the design of the New England Markets. The ISO and others shall have the rights to 
intervene, comment, or protest any such filing (including incentive rate filings) or to file a complaint under 
Section 206 of the Federal Power Act with regard to any such ITC filing. The ISO shall not have the right to 
submit changes to an ITC Rate Schedule pursuant to FPA Section 205. In the event the ISO believes that an 
ITC’s proposed rate or rate structure change (x) would be inconsistent with the design of the New England 
Markets, or (y) could have a material adverse effect on the efficiency or competitiveness of the New 
England Markets, the ability of the ISO to provide transmission access on a not unduly discriminatory or 
preferential basis; or the reliability of the ISO bulk power system; then the ITC’s filing shall include any 
 
 
written statement provided by the ISO setting forth the basis for the ISO’s concerns. All other service to 
load outside the ITC System and for “wheeling through” or “wheeling out” service with respect to the ISO 
region or a portion thereof is subject to all applicable ISO transmission charges under the OATT, not 
including those in the ITC Rate Schedule, provided that the ITC shall have the right to propose any changes 
in the level of the ITC costs reflected in applicable ISO transmission charges not included in the ITC Rate 
Schedule for such service. The PTO AC or the ISO, as applicable pursuant to Section 3.04 of the TOA, shall 
consult with the ITC at least thirty days prior to proposing any rate or rate structure changes to enable the 
ITC to consider the need for any corresponding changes to its own transmission charges.  
 
3.2  
No Rate Pancaking. Notwithstanding its rights under Section 3.1, the ITC shall not implement rates 
or a rate structure which results in a transmission customer paying a pancaked transmission charge for any 
one transaction within the ISO region.  
 
4.  
REVENUE DISTRIBUTION  
4.1  
ITC Receipt of Transmission Revenues. The ITC shall receive and/or retain revenues resulting 
from the provision of transmission service under the OATT or the ITC Rate Schedule if applicable in 
accordance with Section 7 of this Attachment. The ITC may take no unilateral action which interferes with 
or affects the revenue distribution provided for in Section 3.10 of the TOA or which interferes with the 
collection of the revenues due under the OATT for services it provides or arranges. The ITC shall redirect to 
the ISO any payments due to the ISO but erroneously paid to the ITC as soon after discovery of the 
mispayment as practicable and shall provide the ISO with notification of the erroneous payments within 
five (5) Business Days of discovery of the mispayment. The ISO shall redirect any payments due to an ITC 
but erroneously paid to the ISO as soon after discovery of mispayment as practicable and shall provide the 
ITC with notification of the erroneous payments within five (5) Business Days of discovery of the 
mispayment.  
 
4.2  
Redistribution of Revenues. The ITC may redistribute the revenues that it receives pursuant to the 
OATT or the ITC Rate Schedule, if applicable, in any manner it wishes subject to receiving any necessary 
regulatory approvals, without involvement of the ISO.  
 
5.  
ITC OPERATING ACTIONS TO REDUCE CONGESTION  
5.1  
ISO Responsibility for New England Markets, including Congestion Pricing. Subject to 
Commission approval or acceptance, the ISO shall have the rights and obligations to design, develop, 
operate, maintain and administer the New England Markets, including the authority to determine the 
 
 
congestion pricing methodology for the ISO region and will have the authority to calculate congestion 
prices for the region in accordance with the approved or accepted methodology.  
 
5.2  
ITC Operating Actions to Reduce Congestion. An ITC may take actions to reduce congestion on 
the ITC System in accordance with applicable ISO New England Operating Procedures as such ISO New 
England Operating Procedures may be modified pursuant to Section 15 of this Attachment, including but 
not limited to voltage management, the determination of active and passive transmission device settings, 
changes in topology, outage management, and other operating actions affecting the ITC System. The ISO 
shall modify the applicable ISO New England Operating Procedures as necessary to allow for the

respective functions under this Section 5 in accordance with Section 17 of this Attachment.  
 
6.  
LOSSES  
To the extent the ITC is responsible for the costs of losses, the ITC shall possess the unilateral right to file at 
the Commission, without any ISO approval, a mechanism for determining loss responsibility within the 
ITC System, provided that this method does not affect the costs of losses assigned to entities other than the 
ITC in areas outside of the ITC System and is not inconsistent with design of the markets administered by 
the ISO including the congestion pricing methodology for the New England region approved by the 
Commission and any provision for losses contained therein.  
 
7.  
TARIFF ADMINISTRATION  
7.1  
Agreements. The ISO will be the Transmission Provider under the OATT of nondiscriminatory, 
open access transmission services over the ITC System, consistent with this Attachment. The ISO will 
execute the agreements with the customers for transmission service under the OATT on the New England 
Transmission System (including the ITC System). The ISO and the ITC jointly shall enter into agreements 
for studies conducted by the ITC with respect to the ITC System in accordance with Section 7.3. The ITC 
shall enter into interconnection agreements with all entities interconnecting to the ITC System, provided 
that, with respect to the interconnection of a Small or Large Generating Unit to any transmission facility of 
an ITC, the Interconnection Agreement shall be a multi-party agreement among the ITC, the ISO, and the 
interconnecting non-Party based on the pro forma Small or Large Generator Interconnection Agreement in 
 
 
the OATT, and that with respect to the interconnection of other Generating Units to any transmission 
facility of an ITC, the ISO shall be a party to Interconnection Agreements if and to the extent that 
Commission regulations require the ISO to be a party. To the extent applicable under the rate design for the 
ITC Rate Schedule, and to the extent rate discounting is authorized as to such transmission services, the ITC 
shall make all decisions on rate discounts for transmission service for load within the ITC System under the 
ITC Rate Schedule.  
 
7.2  
OASIS. Customers will be able to receive information and apply for transmission service over the 
entire New England Transmission System (including the ITC System) by accessing a single OASIS 
interface maintained by the ISO. If and to the extent the approach to transmission access employed by the 
ISO involves transmission service reservations, the ITC shall possess the right to administer transmission 
service reservations made for transmission service under the ITC Rate Schedule or within the ITC System 
using the single OASIS interface.  
 
7.3  
Studies. If a system impact or other study is required to evaluate the ability of the ITC to provide the 
transmission service and the requested service is within the ITC System, then the ITC shall possess the right 
to assume full responsibility for the study, subject to coordination with the ISO and satisfaction of New 
England reliability criteria for such studies. If a Facilities Study is required to study a constraint within the 
ITC System, then the ITC shall possess the right to assume responsibility for the study subject to 
coordination with the ISO and satisfaction of New England reliability criteria for such studies. The ITC 
shall conduct all such studies in accordance with ITC System Planning Procedures pursuant to Section 15 of 
this Attachment. The ISO shall have the authority to require modifications to such studies if it determines 
that such studies do not adequately address Material Adverse Impacts outside the ITC System or do not 
satisfy New England reliability criteria for such studies. Nothing in this Attachment shall preclude the 
performance of studies related to the interconnection of Generating Units to the ITC System by a third party 
consultant to the extent permitted by applicable procedures in the OATT (including procedures governing 
the treatment of confidential information) and provided that such studies performed by any third party 
consultant must include the ITC’s reasonable estimates of the costs of upgrades to the ITC System needed 
to implement the conclusions of such studies and the ITC’s reasonable anticipated schedule for the 
construction of such upgrades.  
 
7.4  
Long-Term TTC. Where the ITC System encompasses an entire interface within a New England 
Control Area, the ITC shall calculate the long-term TTC of such interface based on seasonal operating 
studies conducted by the ITC that take into account information on anticipated peak loads, facility ratings, 
 
 
scheduled transmission outages, and generator maintenance schedules throughout the Region in accordance 
with formulas and methodology developed jointly with the ISO and subject to coordination with the ISO.  
 
7.5  
Short Term TTC and ATC. The ISO shall adjust short-term TTC on interfaces throughout the ISO 
system (including the ITC System) based on daily forecasts that take into account changes in transmission 
facility ratings, transmission facility and generation outages, and load forecasts. The ISO shall administer 
the ATC calculation and shall calculate, to the extent required, CBM and TRM, based on facility ratings of 
ITC facilities established by the ITC pursuant to Section 9.2 and ISO New England Operating Procedures 
and other assumptions established for the ITC facilities.  
 
8.  
CURTAILMENTS  
8.1  
ITC Responsibilities. The ITC shall develop protocols for the coordination of transmission service 
curtailments on the ITC System, subject to coordination with the ISO and in accordance with all applicable 
OATTs, and applicable ISO New England Operating Procedures pursuant to Section 15 of this Attachment.  
 
8.2  
ISO Responsibilities. The ISO will curtail transmission service in accordance with applicable ISO 
New England Operating Procedures pursuant to Section 15 of this Attachment.  
 
9.

facilities within the ITC System in accordance with Good Utility Practice, provided that such responsibility 
has been transferred to the ITC by the applicable PTO.  
 
9.3  
Transmission Maintenance. The ITC will develop transmission maintenance and outage schedules 
for the ITC System and shall coordinate scheduled transmission maintenance outage schedules with the 
 
 
ISO with an objective of enhancing market efficiency, including the objective of coordinating generation 
and transmission maintenance outage schedules to minimize, to the extent practicable, Congestion Costs 
and Local Second Contingency Protection Resource NCPC Charges. The ISO shall have the authority to 
disapprove transmission maintenance outages on the ITC System if it determines that such outages 
reasonably could be expected to result in a violation of reliability criteria. The ISO shall have the authority 
to revoke its previously granted approval of transmission maintenance outages if forced transmission 
outages or emergency circumstances reasonably could be expected to result in a violation of reliability 
criteria for the New England Transmission System and cancellation of the planned outage reasonably could 
be expected to improve reliability. The ISO shall notify the ITC of the decision to reschedule or revoke 
approval of the transmission maintenance outage as soon as possible after the circumstances arise that 
create the need for the rescheduling or revocation. The ISO shall compensate the ITC for any direct costs 
incurred by the ITC due to the ISO’s rescheduling or revocation of previously approved transmission 
maintenance outages in accordance with and to the extent required by Commission directives.  
 
If the ISO and the PTO(s) proposing an ITC are unable to reach agreement on the terms of any 
Market-related outage authority for ITC transmission facilities, the ISO and the negotiating PTO(s) shall set 
forth their respective positions on such provisions when the ITC Agreement is filed at the Commission.  
 
9.4  
Generation Maintenance. The ITC may coordinate generator maintenance schedules for generators 
within the ITC System with planned transmission outage schedules in accordance with applicable ISO New 
England Operating Procedures pursuant to Section 15 of this Attachment. The ITC may modify its planned 
transmission outage schedules in coordination with generator outage schedules to maximize throughput and 
minimize exposure to congestion while maintaining safe and reliable operation of the ITC System. The ITC 
shall submit any modifications to its planned transmission outage schedules to the ISO, and the ISO shall 
have the authority to disapprove those modifications as specified in Section 9.3. The ITC may also enter 
into agreements with generators with respect to coordination of generator outage schedules and 
transmission outage schedules. The ISO shall have the authority to revoke its previously granted approval 
of generation maintenance outages in accordance with the ISO procedures. The ISO shall notify the 
generators and the ITC of the decision to revoke approval of the generation maintenance outage as soon as 
possible after the circumstances arise that create the need for the revocation.  
 
9.5  
Scheduling and Dispatch. The ISO will schedule and dispatch generation and load within the New 
England Transmission System, including the ITC System. The ITC will manage the configuration and 
topology of transmission facilities on the ITC System, including the scheduling and performance of 
 
 
transmission operations actions in accordance with applicable ISO New England Operating Procedures, as 
such ISO New England Operating Procedures may be developed or modified pursuant to Section 15 of this 
Attachment to address reliability and/or to improve market or operational efficiency, subject to the ISO’s 
ultimate authority to intercede and direct appropriate actions in its role as the regional Reliability Authority.  
 
9.6  
Information. The ISO and the ITC shall share information required for them to fulfill their 
respective functions under this Section 9 in accordance with Section 17 of this Attachment.  
 
10.  
PLANNING  
10.1  
Needs Assessment. The ISO has the responsibility for the development of a regional needs 
assessment for the ISO region. The ITC shall have the right to participate in the development of such 
regional needs assessment and shall have the responsibility for developing a system needs assessment for 
the ITC System.  
 
The ITC shall provide the technical and analytical studies for the ITC System in accordance with ITC 
System Planning Procedures developed pursuant to Section 15 of this Attachment. The ITC may also 
provide technical and analytical studies in coordination with the ISO for the ISO region, if requested by the 
ISO. The ISO will adopt and/or develop planning criteria for the ISO system. The ITC, in consultation with 
the ISO, shall develop the transmission planning criteria for the ITC System consistent with the ISO 
planning criteria, the applicable criteria of ERO and the criteria of area reliability councils. The ISO shall 
publish the completed needs assessment for the ISO region on its website. The completed needs assessment 
shall include the system needs assessment for the ITC System developed by the ITC in consultation with the 
ISO as well as any needs within the ITC System identified by the ISO and not included in the ITC System 
needs assessment. If the ITC or the ISO disagrees with the inclusion or exclusion of particular needs as to 
the ITC System, the party shall so note in the final needs assessment.  
 
10.2  
Development of the ITC Plan. The ITC shall develop, with respect to the ITC System, options for 
new transmission projects, the use of innovative technology, and improved utilization of existing 
transmission facilities in response to the needs assessment. The ITC may also identify additional needs in 
the process of analysis and incorporate such needs in the development of the ITC plan. The ITC shall 
develop the ITC plan in accordance with ITC System Planning Procedures developed pursuant to Section 
15 of this Attachment. Under the regional planning process, Market Participants will have the opportunity 
to propose other projects such as generation, merchant transmission and demand response programs that 
may eliminate the need for new transmission within the ITC System in response to the needs assessment. 
 
 
The ITC shall issue its draft plan for the construction of transmission facilities within the ITC System to 
meet ITC System needs identified in the needs assessment phase.  
 
10.3  
ISO Evaluation, Refinement and Approval. In accordance with the procedures established for 
public review and ISO assessment of the Regional System Plan, the ISO shall provide a draft report on the 
recommendations for the Regional System Plan, including the draft ITC plan, for public review and 
comment. Following review and consideration of comments, the ISO shall provide its assessment of 
whether proposals submitted by Market Participants are likely to adequately and appropriately meet the 
regional needs identified in the needs assessment phase, including needs within the ITC System. Where 
more than one market-based proposal appropriately meets the needs to solve a potential ITC System 
deficiency, the ISO shall not choose between the proposals. The decision to proceed with market-based 
proposals (including merchant transmission) will be made by the market. The ISO shall provide the ITC its 
final assessment as to whether it believes transmission projects included in the draft ITC plan are likely to 
adequately and appropriately meet the regional needs identified in the needs assessment phase, including 
needs within the ITC System.  
 
If the ISO determines that one or more projects in the draft ITC plan adequately and appropriately meets 
needs identified in the ISO needs assessment or an ITC needs assessment with which the ISO agrees, then 
the projects in the ITC plan addressing those needs shall become part of the final Regional System Plan. If 
the ISO determines that projects in the draft ITC plan do not fully meet needs identified in the ISO needs 
assessment or an ITC needs assessment with which the ISO agrees but are nonetheless appropriate, then the 
projects in the draft ITC plan shall become part of the final Regional System Plan. In the event that: (i) the 
ISO determines that any of the projects identified in the ITC plan do not adequately or appropriately meet 
the ISO needs assessment or an ITC needs assessment with which the ISO agrees, or (ii) the ISO disagrees 
with the ITC needs assessment, then the ITC may determine whether such projects in the ITC plan shall be 
listed in the Regional System Plan, provided that the ISO may designate such projects as “not approved.” In 
making a determination that an ITC project is “not approved,” the ISO shall identify the reasons for making 
such designation.  
 
The ISO will review all of the projects identified in a draft ITC plan in order to determine if any of the 
projects would cause a Material Adverse Impact on facilities that are not a part of the ITC System that are 
within the New England Transmission System . If the ISO determines that a project identified in the ITC 
plan would cause a Material Adverse Impact on facilities that are not a part of the ITC System that are 
within the New England Transmission System, that project may not be included in the ISO System Plan.  
 
 
 
If such a project within an ITC Plan is designated as “not approved” by the ISO or is not included in the 
Regional System Plan, then the costs of such projects shall not be included in rates under the OATT 
(including the ITC Rate Schedule) unless the ITC applies to the Commission for the inclusion of the costs of 
any such transmission project in rates under the OATT (including the ITC Rate Schedule), and the 
Commission approves or accepts such filing. The ISO shall have the right to intervene in, comment on, or 
file a protest in such proceeding before the Commission.  
 
The ISO may direct the ITC to construct a transmission project within the ITC System that is not included in 
the draft ITC plan if the ISO determines that such transmission project is needed to adequately and 
appropriately address a regional need. The ITC shall be obligated to construct such transmission project 
pursuant to the same terms and conditions as set forth in Schedule 3.09(a) to the TOA. Such transmission 
projects shall be identified in the Regional System Plan.  
10.4  
Information. The ITC and the ISO shall share information required for them to fulfill their 
respective functions under this Section 10 in accordance with Section 17 of this Attachment.  
 
11.  
BILLING AND SETTLEMENT  
The ITC possesses the right to perform the billing, settlement, and accounting responsibilities for those 
transactions under its Rate Schedule under the OATT. The ITC may elect to contract for the performance of 
those functions by the ISO or another third party.  
 
12.  
MARKET MONITORING  
12.1  
ISO Responsibilities. The Market Monitoring Unit of the ISO shall, among its other functions, 
perform market monitoring functions for market transactions involving the use of the ITC facilities.  
 
12.2  
Monitoring and Assessment of the ITC. The ITC-ISO relationship shall be monitored to determine 
if the division of functions creates a competitive or reliability problem that affects the ISO’s ability to 
provide efficient, reliable, and non-discriminatory transmission service and administration of markets 
within the ISO region. The ITC’s administration of its responsibilities shall also be monitored to determine 
whether its administration adversely affects the system reliability or the competitiveness or efficiency of 
any market administered by the ISO.  
 
13.  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION  
 
 
Any dispute arising under this Attachment M shall be the subject of good-faith negotiations among the ISO, 
the affected ITC and affected market participants, if any. The ISO, each affected ITC, and each affected 
market participant shall designate one or more representatives with the authority to negotiate the matter in 
dispute to participate in such negotiations. The ISO, each affected ITC, and each affected market participant 
shall engage in such good-faith negotiations for a period of not less than 60 calendar days, unless: (a) the 
ISO, an affected ITC, or an affected market participant identifies exigent circumstances reasonably 
requiring expedited resolution of the dispute by the Commission or a court or agency with jurisdiction over 
the dispute. Any other dispute that is not resolved through good-faith negotiations may, by the ISO, any 
ITC, or any market participant, be submitted for resolution by the Commission or a court or agency with 
jurisdiction over the dispute upon the conclusion of such negotiations. The ISO, any ITC, or any market 
participant may request that any dispute submitted to the Commission for resolution be subject to the 
Commission settlement procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute arising under this 
Attachment M may be submitted to arbitration or any other form of alternative dispute resolution upon the 
agreement of the ISO, all affected ITCs and all affected market participants to participate in such an 
alternative dispute resolution process.  
 
14.  
NOTIFICATION OF ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES  
The ITC shall provide notice to the ISO of its election to assume the responsibilities set forth herein or in a 
Commission-approved ITC Agreement. Following receipt of required approvals, the ITC and the ISO will 
allow, prior to the ITC’s assumption of responsibilities, sufficient time to implement modifications to

ATTACHMENT N 
PROCEDURES FOR REGIONAL SYSTEM PLAN UPGRADES 
 
I.  
INTRODUCTION  
Pursuant to Part II.G of the ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff (Sections II.46 – II.47), 
Attachment K and this Attachment, the ISO shall classify upgrades as Reliability Transmission Upgrades,  
Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades, Public Policy Transmission Upgrades or Longer-Term 
Transmission Upgrades during the Regional System Plan (“RSP”) process. Pursuant to established 
standards, that process is designed to collect and reflect broad input from all stakeholders through the 
Planning Advisory Committee (“PAC”). The PAC is composed of a wide variety of regional 
stakeholders, including Governance Participants (such as generator owners, marketers, load serving 
entities, merchant transmission owners and participating transmission owners), governmental 
representatives, public interest groups, state agencies (including those participating in the New England 
Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners), retail customers, representatives of local communities, 
and consultants. The PAC meets regularly throughout the year.  
 
This procedure describes the standards used by the ISO to identify Reliability Transmission Upgrades, 
Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades, Public Policy Transmission Upgrades and Longer-Term 
Transmission Upgrades and the process for making such identifications pursuant to Part II.G and 
Attachment K of the OATT.  
 
The ISO may amend these standards and procedures from time to time, as appropriate, with input from 
the Reliability Committee and PAC.  
 
II.

A.  
Identification of Reliability Transmission Upgrades  
Reliability Transmission Upgrades are those upgrades necessary to ensure the continued reliability of the 
New England Transmission System based on applicable reliability standards. In applying the applicable 
reliability standards, some of the considerations that will be taken into account are as follows:  
 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
• 
available supply and transmission (i.e., known resource changes, which includes anticipated 
transmission enhancements (considering Elective Transmission Upgrades and Merchant 
Transmission Facilities), demand side resources, and new, retired or unavailable generators);  
• 
load growth;  
• 
acceptable stability response;  
• 
acceptable short circuit capability;  
• 
acceptable voltage levels;  
• 
adequate thermal capability; and  
• 
acceptable system operability and responses (e.g. automatic operations, voltage changes).  
 
To identify the transmission system facilities required to maintain reliability and system performance 
consistent with the applicable reliability standards, the ISO shall:  
 
• 
determine whether the above factors are met using reasonable assumptions for certain amounts of 
forecasted load growth, and generation and transmission facility availability (due to maintenance, 
forced outages, or other unavailability); and  
• 
rely on Good Utility Practice, applicable reliability standards, and the ISO System Rules.  
 
A Reliability Transmission Upgrade is not an upgrade required by the interconnection of a generator 
except to the extent determined under the terms of Schedule 11 of the OATT. A Reliability Transmission 
Upgrade may also provide market efficiency benefits.  
 
B.  
Identification of Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades  
Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades are upgrades designed primarily to provide a net reduction in 
total production cost to supply the system load. Proposed Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades shall 
be identified by the ISO where the net present value of the net reduction in total cost to supply the system 
load, as determined by the ISO, exceeds the net present value of the carrying cost of the identified 
transmission upgrade.  
 
An upgrade identified as a Reliability Transmission Upgrade may qualify for interim treatment as a 
Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrade if market efficiency is used to influence the schedule for the 
implementation of the upgrade. Such opportunities shall be identified by the ISO when the net present 
value of the reduction to total production cost to supply the system load, as determined by the ISO, 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
exceeds the net present value of the Reliability Transmission Upgrade after it is advanced less the net 
present value of the upgrade for when it is projected to be needed for reliability.  
 
1.  
Base Economic Evaluation Model  
In making a determination of the net present value of bulk power system resource costs, the ISO 
shall take into account applicable economic factors that shall include the following projected 
factors:  
• 
energy costs;  
• 
Capacity Costs;  
• 
cost of supplying total operating reserve;  
• 
system losses;  
• 
available supply and transmission (i.e., known resource changes, which includes anticipated 
transmission enhancements (considering Elective Transmission Upgrades and Merchant 
Transmission Facilities), demand side resources and new, retired or unavailable generators);  
• 
load growth;  
• 
fuel costs;  
• 
fuel availability;  
• 
generator availability;  
• 
release of bottled generating resources;  
• 
present worth factors for each project specific to the owner of the project;  
• 
present worth period not to exceed ten years; and  
• 
cost of the project.  
 
Analysis may include utilization of historical information such as may be included in market 
reports as well as special studies and should report cumulative net present value annually over the 
study period.    
 
2.  
Other Data Provided to Stakeholders  
Although not used to evaluate the net economic benefit of the system upgrade, analysis may be 
provided to illustrate the net cost to load with and without the transmission upgrade – considering 
additional factors such as locational installed capacity, congestion costs, and impacts on bilateral 
prices for electricity.    
 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
Summary  
Based on information provided through such analysis and pursuant to the factors listed in (1) above, the 
ISO, in consultation with the PAC, will identify Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades to be included 
in the RSP. If however, during the course of their analysis, the ISO determines that without the project the 
applicable reliability standards will not be met, then the project will be designated as a Reliability 
Transmission Upgrade and included in the RSP as such.  
 
C. 
Identification of Public Policy Transmission Upgrades 
Public Policy Transmission Upgrades are upgrades designed to meet transmission needs driven by public 
policy requirements, including such needs identified by NESCOE.  Proposed Public Policy Transmission 
Upgrades shall be assessed and identified by the ISO in accordance with Section 4A of Attachment K to 
the OATT.  
 
D. 
Identification of Longer-Term Transmission Upgrades 
Longer-Term Transmission Upgrades are upgrades designed to meet transmission needs identified by 
NESCOE in accordance with Section 16 of Attachment K.  Proposed Longer-Term Transmission 
Upgrades shall be assessed and identified by the ISO in accordance with Section 16 of Attachment K to 
the OATT. 
 
III.  
PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING RELIABILITY TRANSMISSION UPGRADES, 
MARKET EFFICIENCY TRANSMISSION UPGRADES, PUBLIC POLICY 
TRANSMISSION UPGRADES AND LONGER-TERM TRANSMISSION UPGRADES 
  
A.  
Identification of Needs for Reliability Transmission Upgrades, Market Efficiency 
Transmission Upgrade, Public Policy Transmission Upgrades and Longer-Term 
Transmission Upgrades 
  
1.  
An assessment of the adequacy of the region’s electric system.   
On a regular and on-going basis, the ISO shall conduct studies to identify the location and nature 
of any potential problems on the New England Transmission System. These assessments shall be 
conducted to identify those factors relevant to the standards for identifying needs which might be 
solved or mitigated by Reliability Transmission Upgrades and Market Efficiency Transmission 
Upgrades, as specified in Section II of this Attachment.  
 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
The ISO will publish its identification of such relevant factors on the New England Transmission 
System on its website and to the PAC, thereby providing market signals for generation, merchant 
transmission and load responses to develop and implement market-based solutions for the relief 
of actual and projected system reliability concerns, transmission constraints and market 
inefficiencies. The ISO will also present the results of its assessments in appropriate market 
forums to facilitate market responses to those needs. Market responses having met appropriate 
milestones pursuant to Attachment K to the OATT will be included in studies to assess the effects 
of such market responses on the identified problems with reliability and market inefficiencies.  
 
Based on input and feedback provided by the PAC, the ISO shall refer to the Markets Committee 
and Reliability Committee issues and concerns identified by the PAC for further investigations 
and consideration of potential changes to rules and procedures.  
 
2.  
Conduct of Public Policy Transmission Studies 
 
The ISO will conduct the public policy transmission planning process pursuant to the timelines 
and procedures set out in Section 4A of Attachment K to this OATT.  
 
3.  
Conduct of Longer-Term Transmission Studies 
The ISO will conduct the longer-term transmission planning process pursuant to the timelines and 
procedures set out in Section 16 of Attachment K to this OATT. 
 
B. 
Adequacy of the market responses, and as necessary, adequacy of Reliability Transmission 
Upgrades and Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades  
The ISO shall assess the adequacy of proposed market responses in addressing identified system 
needs. The ISO shall also ensure that there are no significant adverse effects associated with such 
market responses, pursuant to Section I.3.9 of the Tariff and Planning Procedure 5-3, “Guidelines 
for Conducting and Evaluating Proposed Plan Application Analysis”.  
 
If the market does not respond with adequate solutions to address the system needs identified by 
the ISO, the ISO shall present a coordinated transmission plan in the RSP that identifies 
appropriate projects for addressing both reliability, and market efficiency needs.  
 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
This coordinated plan is updated by the ISO as market responses to identified problems are 
developed. Reliability Transmission Upgrades and Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades are 
implemented only after market solutions have been given first consideration.  
 
C.  
Periodic Updates to the RSP  
A Reliability Transmission Upgrade or Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrade may be added 
to the RSP at any time in a given year, a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade project may be 
added to the RSP in accordance with Sections 3.6 and 4A of Attachment K to the OATT, and a 
Longer-Term Transmission Upgrade project may be added to the RSP in accordance with 
Sections 3.6 and 16 of Attachment K to the OATT.  In doing so, the ISO shall consult with and 
consider input from the PAC and the Reliability Committee, within the scope of their respective 
functions.  
 
The time required to implement transmission projects, however, is often longer than that needed 
for market-based solutions. Thus, the RSP process recognizes that a new market response could 
result in a deferral or a significant change in the proposed timing and/or configuration of a 
Reliability Transmission Upgrade or Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades. Also, a needed 
Reliability Transmission Upgrade or Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrade may become 
delayed due to other factors.  
 
As a result, the ISO may remove or defer a Reliability Transmission Upgrade or Market 
Efficiency Transmission Upgrade project from the RSP at any time in a given year, if the market 
responds by developing credible market-based solutions, or other circumstances arise that impact 
the need for the Transmission Upgrade. If market-based solutions have not met appropriate 
milestones prior to significant sunk transmission expense being made to provide the Reliability 
Transmission Upgrade or Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrade, then the ISO will assess the 
risks and costs associated with adding or advancing a transmission project from the RSP. The ISO 
may remove a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade project from the RSP in accordance with 
Sections 3.6 and 4A of Attachment K to the OATT.  The ISO may remove a Longer-Term 
Transmission Upgrade project from the RSP in accordance with Sections 3.6 and 16 of 
Attachment K to the OATT.  The ISO shall consult with and consider input from the PAC and 
the Reliability Committee with regard to such changes in the RSP. In the event that a 
transmission project is removed, deferred, added or advanced, the ISO shall promptly notify the 
affected Participating Transmission Owners and Non-Incumbent Transmission Developers.  
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000 
 
IV.  
COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND COST ALLOCATION DETERMINATION OF 
RELIABILITY TRANSMISSION UPGRADES AND MARKET EFFICIENCY 
TRANSMISSION UPGRADES  
The cost-effectiveness and cost allocation of identified Reliability Transmission Upgrades and Market 
Efficiency Transmission Upgrades will be determined pursuant to the Tariff, Attachment K; Schedule 12; 
and Planning Procedure 4. The level of detail needed to fulfill the requirements of the RSP process and 
Planning Procedure 4 will ensure that, in addition to a determination of Pool-supported PTF costs and 
Localized Costs, the planning and stakeholder review processes will include a comprehensive 
examination of all Transmission Upgrade construction alternatives and their associated costs and will thus 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each Transmission Upgrade and its potential alternatives.

transformer. 
(iv) 
To the extent there is any dispute between the ISO and NTD as owner of 
a transmission facility concerning classification of such transmission facility under these 
standards, such disagreement shall be subject to the dispute resolution provisions of this 
Agreement, provided that the ISO’s classification of a transmission facility under the 
standards shall govern pending resolution of the dispute. 
Collectively, all NTD Category A Facilities, NTD Category B Facilities, and NTD Local 
Area Facilities shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Transmission Facilities,” provided that 
“Transmission Facilities” shall not include Excluded Assets as defined in Section 2.04 of this Agreement 
or Merchant Facilities.  The ISO shall maintain on its OASIS a posting of the current versions of 
Schedule 2.01(a) and Schedule 2.01(b), in each instance, reflecting each such change promptly after such 
change is made. 
(f) 
The classifications set forth in this Section 2.01 are for operational purposes.

Agreement, it being understood that NTD shall enter into operating agreements relating to its Merchant 
Facilities directly with the ISO in accordance with applicable provisions of the ISO OATT.  Nothing in 
this Agreement is intended to limit or expand the right of NTD, the Affiliate of NTD, or any other entity 
to propose, construct, or own Merchant Facilities interconnected to the New England Transmission 
System.  No Merchant Facility may become an Acquired Transmission Facility. 
2.04 
Excluded Assets.  The “Excluded Assets” of NTD shall consist of those assets and/or 
facilities of NTD set forth in Section 2.04(a) and (b).  These Excluded Assets are expressly excluded from 
the definition of Transmission Facilities under this Agreement, and the ISO shall not have Operating 
Authority over NTD’s Excluded Assets.  Nothing in this Section 2.04 is intended to address the rate 
treatment of the Transmission Facilities or any other asset of NTD.  Rate treatment of Transmission 
Facilities shall be governed by the ISO OATT, provided that filings for rate treatment under the ISO 
OATT shall be subject to Section 3.04 of this Agreement: 
(a) 
Excluded Assets are any assets, facilities, and/or portions of facilities owned by 
NTD that are connected with or associated with Transmission Facilities to the extent specifically excluded 
pursuant to the following items (i) through (vii) of this Section 2.04(a):

If NTD, the ISO and the interconnecting non-Party agree to the terms and conditions of a 
specific Large Generator Interconnection Agreement or Small Generator Interconnection 
Agreement, as applicable, or any amendments to such an Interconnection Agreement, 
then NTD and the ISO shall jointly file the executed Interconnection Agreement, or 
amendment thereto, with FERC under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  To the 
extent NTD, the ISO and such interconnecting non-Party cannot agree to proposed 
variations from the Schedule 22 or 23 Interconnection Agreement applicable to a Large 
Generating Facility or Small Generating Facility, respectively, or cannot otherwise agree 
to the terms and conditions of the Interconnection Agreement, or any amendments to 
such an Interconnection Agreement, then NTD and the ISO shall jointly file an 
unexecuted Interconnection Agreement, or amendment thereto, with FERC under Section 
205 of the Federal Power Act and shall identify the areas of disagreement in such filing, 
provided that, in the event of disagreement on terms and conditions of the 
Interconnection Agreement related to the costs of upgrades to the Transmission Facilities, 
the anticipated schedule for the construction of such upgrades, any financial obligations 
of NTD, and any provisions related to physical impacts of the interconnection on the 
Transmission Facilities or other assets, then the standard applicable under Section 205 of 
the Federal Power Act shall apply only to NTD’s position on such terms and conditions. 
The costs of interconnection facilities shall be allocated in the manner specified 
in the ISO OATT. 
(b) 
NTD shall also connect its Transmission Facilities (once placed in service) with 
the facilities of any entity that is not a Party upon satisfaction of the “Elective Transmission Upgrade”

“Elective Transmission Upgrade Applicant”) upon satisfaction of the following conditions: 
(i) 
The Elective Transmission Upgrade Applicant shall enter into an 
Interconnection Agreement with the affected PTO(s) and NTD and, to the extent 
necessary and appropriate, enter into support agreements with the affected PTO(s) and 
NTD, provided that the Elective Transmission Upgrade Applicant may request, upon 
providing the security, credit assurances, and/or deposits required by the affected PTO, 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000
 
the filing with the Commission by NTD and/or affected PTOs of unexecuted 
Interconnection Agreements and support agreements. 
(ii) 
The Elective Transmission Upgrade Applicant shall obtain all necessary 
legal rights and approvals for the construction and maintenance of the upgrade and shall 
cooperate with NTD in obtaining all necessary legal rights and approvals for the 
construction and maintenance of additions or modifications, if any, required in 
conjunction with the upgrade. 
(iii) 
The Elective Transmission Upgrade Applicant shall be responsible for 
100% of all of the costs of said upgrade and of any additions to or modifications of the 
Transmission Facilities that are required to accommodate the Elective Transmission 
Upgrade.  A request for rate treatment of an Elective Transmission Upgrade, if any, shall 
be determined by FERC in the appropriate proceeding. 
2.06 
Review of Transmission Plans.  NTD shall submit to the ISO in such form, manner and 
detail as the ISO may reasonably prescribe:  (i) any new or materially changed plans for retirements of or 
changes in the capacity of such Transmission Facilities rated 69 kV or above or plans for construction of 
New Transmission Facilities or Transmission Upgrades rated 69 kV or above; and (ii) any new or 
materially changed plan for any other action to be taken by NTD which may have a significant effect on 
the stability, reliability or operating characteristics of the Transmission Facilities, the facilities of any 
Transmission Owner, or the system of a Participant.  The ISO shall provide notification of any such NTD 
submissions to the appropriate Technical Committee(s).  Unless prior to the expiration of ninety (90) 
days, the ISO notifies NTD in writing that it has determined that implementation of the plan will have a 
significant adverse effect upon the reliability or operating characteristics of the Transmission Facilities, 
the facilities of any Transmission Owner, or the system of a Participant, NTD shall be free to proceed.  If 
the ISO notifies NTD that implementation of such plan has been determined to have a significant adverse 
effect upon the reliability or operating characteristics of the Transmission Facilities, the facilities of any 
Transmission Owner, or the system of a Participant, NTD shall not proceed to implement such plan 
unless NTD takes such action or constructs such facilities as the ISO determines to be reasonably 
necessary to avoid such adverse effect. 
2.07 
Condemnation.  If, at any time, any Governmental Authority commences any process to 
acquire any Transmission Facilities or any other interest in Transmission Facilities then held by NTD 
Effective Date: 7/9/2024 – ER24-1978-000
 
through condemnation or otherwise through the power of eminent domain, (i) NTD shall provide the ISO 
with written notice of such process, (ii) NTD shall, at its cost, direct any litigation or proceeding 
regarding such condemnation or eminent domain matter, (iii) NTD shall have the right to settle any such 
proceeding without the consent of the ISO, and (iv) any award in condemnation or eminent domain shall 
be paid to NTD without any claim to such award by the ISO.
