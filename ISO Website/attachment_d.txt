Introduction  
The ISO New England Information Policy establishes rules and guidelines regarding the appropriate 
disclosure of all information received, created and distributed in connection with the operation of and 
participation in the markets administered by ISO New England Inc. (the “ISO”). The Information Policy 
allows stakeholder committees, task forces and working groups (collectively, “Stakeholder Committees”), 
the ISO, and Governance Participants to share information with the benefit of a common understanding 
regarding how that information will be used and how appropriate confidentiality will be maintained.  
The Information Policy document consists of three sections. Section 1 highlights the Information Policy's 
intent and objectives. Section 2 discusses confidentiality issues. Finally, Section 3 specifies what types of 
information are available to whom.  
Changes to the Information Policy will be made in accordance with Section 11.3 of the Participants 
Agreement.  
 
Section 1 -Policy Intent & Objectives  
The intent of the Information Policy is twofold. First, to allow Governance Participants to provide certain 
Confidential Information to the ISO, Stakeholder Committees, and other Governance Participants with 
the benefit of a common understanding regarding how that information will be used and how appropriate 
confidentiality will be maintained. Second, to provide the ISO, Stakeholder Committees and Governance 
Participants clear guidance regarding the appropriate disclosure of all information received, created or 
distributed in connection with the operation of and participation in the markets administered by the ISO. 
The Information Policy will pertain to all information held by Stakeholder Committees or the ISO, or 
furnished by or to a Governance Participant as a result of its participation in the markets administered by 
the ISO, whether it is publicly available or strictly confidential.  
 
In order to meet the general obligations of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff, the Participants 
Agreement, the Transmission Operating Agreement, the Rate Design and Funds Disbursement 
Agreement, and other documents that affect the rates, terms, and conditions of service, including all 
exhibits and attachments to the listed documents (hereafter collectively referred to as the “Filed 
Documents”), each Governance Participant is required to furnish to and may be entitled to receive from 
Stakeholder Committees or the ISO certain information, some of which may be considered confidential, 
commercially sensitive, and/or strategic in nature. This information is used by the ISO, Stakeholder 
Committees or Governance Participants, as appropriate, for the following purposes, among others:  
 
1.  
To operate the bulk power supply system on a day-to-day basis.  
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
 
2. 
To administer the Open Access Transmission Tariff.  
 
3. 
To administer the New England electricity markets, including the bidding process, billing system 
and settlement function.  
 
4. 
To monitor the competitiveness and efficiency of the market and Governance Participants' 
compliance with relevant market rules and procedures.  
 
5. 
To assess and plan for the long term reliability and adequacy of the New England bulk power 
supply system.  
 
6. 
To provide reports and data as required or appropriate to the various user groups as described in 
Section 3 of this Information Policy.  
 
It is recognized that the successful operation of the New England Control Area is highly dependent on 
access to certain types of information. The high degree of bulk power supply reliability and adequacy that 
customers of Governance Participants have become accustomed to expect is, to some degree, a result of 
Governance Participants' willingness to provide the necessary information. It is only with the ISO's 
continued access to the information necessary to perform its duties described above that the benefits 
obtained from bulk power supply pooling can continue. 
  
This Information Policy will:  
 
1. 
Recognize that protecting the confidentiality of certain information is important to the 
Governance Participants.  
 
2. 
Recognize that the ISO and each Governance Participant have the responsibility to protect the 
confidentiality of such information.  
 
3. 
Provide procedures and guidelines to the ISO, Stakeholder Committees and Governance 
Participants regarding the handling, publication and distribution of all information.  
 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
This Information Policy is intended to comport with the obligation of the ISO, Stakeholder Committees 
and the Governance Participants to comply fully with the antitrust laws and the information access and 
disclosure provisions of the standards of conduct for transmission providers promulgated by the 
Commission in 18 C.F.R.  Part 358. The Information Policy is expressly intended both: (1) to protect 
against the disclosure of Confidential Information that could facilitate anticompetitive conduct prohibited 
by the antitrust laws and (2) to distribute information to the extent and in a manner consistent with 
preserving the competitiveness and efficiency of the New England electric markets and the reliability of 
the bulk power system.  
 
No modifications or additions shall be made to Section 3 of this document that result in limiting the 
disclosure of Confidential Information by Governance Participants that are municipalities, state or 
municipal agencies, or other public agencies unless such information contains trade secrets or commercial 
or financial information that has otherwise been kept confidential.  
 
Section 2 -Confidentiality Issues  
 
2.0 
Confidentiality  
Confidential Information furnished by a Governance Participant to Stakeholder Committees and/or the 
ISO shall, for the purposes of this Information Policy, be considered the sole and exclusive property of 
such Governance Participant (the “Furnishing Governance Participant”). To the extent that such 
Confidential Information is furnished to Stakeholder Committees and/or the ISO it shall be used solely to 
perform their obligations under the NEPOOL Agreement and the Participants Agreement. No Governance 
Participant shall be entitled to receive from the ISO and/or Stakeholder Committees any Confidential 
Information furnished by another Governance Participant under the NEPOOL Agreement unless the 
Furnishing Governance Participant has provided the relevant Stakeholder Committees and/or the ISO 
written authorization for such release. The disclosure of Confidential Information in accordance with this 
Information Policy shall not be used by any Governance Participant as a basis for a claim that the 
Governance Participant furnishing such Confidential Information has waived, relinquished, or reduced in 
any way the Furnishing Governance Participant’s rights to prevent further disclosure of such Confidential 
Information.  
 
The Governance Participants recognize that one of the purposes of the ISO is to prepare analyses, 
forecasts and reports for the general public, reliability councils, regulators and other user groups. 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Preparation of such analyses, forecasts and reports requires the use of Governance Participants’ 
information, some of which may be Confidential Information of an individual Governance Participant.  
 
Governance Participants’ obligations to provide information to the ISO or Stakeholder Committees arise 
under the Filed Documents. Nothing in this Information Policy is intended to expand or alter those 
obligations. Nothing in this Information Policy requires the ISO to release information to Stakeholder 
Committees, Governance Participants or any other person if the ISO in good faith believes that the release 
of such information would violate any applicable law or regulation or the terms of any valid 
confidentiality agreement or have a material adverse effect on the competitiveness or efficiency of the 
markets administered by the ISO.  
 
2.1  
Confidential Information  
The following information will be considered Confidential Information for the purposes of this Policy:  
 
(a)  
Information that (i) is furnished by a Governance Participant (the “Furnishing Governance 
Participant”) to the ISO, Stakeholder Committees or another Governance Participant, (ii) 
constitutes trade secrets or commercial or financial information, the disclosure of which would 
harm the Furnishing Governance Participant or prejudice the position of that Governance 
Participant in the New England electricity markets, and (iii) has been designated in writing by the 
Furnishing Governance Participant as confidential or proprietary either in the document which 
provided such information, in the transmittal materials accompanying such information, or in a 
separate document which identifies the information with sufficient specificity and clarity so that 
the entity receiving such information has been made aware that the Furnishing Governance 
Participant seeks confidential treatment for such information, or, is classified as  a type of 
confidential or proprietary information pursuant to Section 3.0.  
 
(b)  
Information that (i) is furnished by the ISO to a Governance Participant or a Stakeholder 
Committee, (ii) constitutes trade secrets or commercial or financial information the disclosure of 
which would have an adverse effect on the ability of the ISO to perform its responsibilities under 
the Participants Agreement, and (iii) has been designated in writing by the ISO as confidential or 
proprietary either in the document which provided such information, in transmittal materials 
accompanying such information, or in a separate document which identifies the information with 
sufficient specificity and clarity so that the entity receiving such information has been made 
aware that the ISO seeks confidential treatment for such information. In addition, information that 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
is furnished by the ISO to a Governance Participant or a Stakeholder Committee relating to the 
job status or performance or terms of employment of any ISO employee shall be Confidential 
Information.  
 
(c)  
Information that (i) is furnished by a non-Governance Participant that takes part in a demand 
response program operated by the ISO (a “DR Information Provider”) to the ISO, Stakeholder 
Committees or any Governance Participant in connection with the demand response program, (ii) 
constitutes trade secrets or commercial or financial information, the disclosure of which would 
harm the DR Information Provider or prejudice the position of the DR Information Provider in 
the demand response program, and (iii) has been designated in writing by the DR Information 
Provider as confidential or proprietary either in the document which provided such information, 
in the transmittal materials accompanying such information, or in a separate document that 
identifies the information with sufficient specificity and clarity so that the entity receiving such 
information has been made aware that the DR Information Provider seeks confidential treatment 
for such information.  
 
(d)  
Information that (i) is furnished by a non-Governance Participant acting as a Project Sponsor to 
the ISO, Stakeholder Committees or any Governance Participant in connection with the Forward 
Capacity Market, (ii) constitutes trade secrets or commercial or financial information, the 
disclosure of which would harm the Project Sponsor or prejudice the position of the Project 
Sponsor in the Forward Capacity Market, and (iii) has been designated in writing by the Project 
Sponsor as confidential or proprietary either in the document which provided such information, in 
the transmittal materials accompanying such information, or in a separate document that 
identifies the information with sufficient specificity and clarity so that the entity receiving such 
information has been made aware that the Project Sponsor seeks confidential treatment for such 
information.  
 
(e) 
Information disclosed to satisfy the “Minimum Criteria for Market Participation” set forth in 
Section II.A of the ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy that (i) is furnished by a 
Furnishing Governance Participant to the ISO, Stakeholder Committees or another Governance 
Participant or is furnished by the ISO to a Governance Participant or a Stakeholder Committee, 
(ii) constitutes sensitive or non-public information concerning the Participant or identifying or 
concerning the Principals of a Participant, the disclosure of which could harm the Furnishing 
Governance Participant or its Principals, and (iii) has been designated in writing by the 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Furnishing Governance Participant or by the ISO as confidential either in the document which 
provided such information, in the transmittal materials accompanying such information, or in a 
separate document which identifies the information with sufficient specificity and clarity so that 
the entity receiving such information has been made aware that the Furnishing Governance 
Participant or the ISO seeks confidential treatment for such information. 
 
(f) 
Consistent with the Commission’s Order No. 895, information furnished to the ISO by a 
Commission-jurisdictional regional transmission organization or independent system operator (an 
“Other RTO/ISO”) that relates to the creditworthiness of a market participant of such Other 
RTO/ISO or an applicant to become a market participant of such Other RTO/ISO for the purpose 
of credit risk management and mitigation, including without limitation information of the 
respective Affiliates of the foregoing; provided that Sections 3.1 and 3.4 will not be applicable 
with respect to such information. The ISO may use such credit-related information to the same 
extent and for the same purposes as the ISO uses credit-related information collected from its 
own Market Participants, Non-Market Participant Transmission Customers, and Applicants in 
accordance with the ISO Tariff (including without limitation the ISO New England Financial 
Assurance Policy). 
 
(g)  
Any report, compilation or communication produced by the ISO or a Stakeholder Committee that 
(i) contains information described in Clause (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) above and allows for the 
specific identification of the Furnishing Governance Participant, the DR Information Provider, 
the market participant of an Other RTO/ISO, or an applicant to become a market participant of an 
Other RTO/ISO, as applicable.  
 
Confidential Information shall exclude information if and to the extent such information (1) is or becomes 
generally available to the public without any party violating any obligation of secrecy relating to the 
information disclosed, or (2) is received by a Governance Participant in good faith from a third party who 
discloses such information on a non-confidential basis without violating any obligation of secrecy relating 
to the information disclosed, or (3) is defined as “Public Information,” in Section 3, or (4) can be shown 
by the recipient's prior records to have been already known to the recipient other than through disclosure 
by a third party which would not be subject to exclusion based on (2) above.  
 
Confidential Information, as defined in this Section 2.1, may be provided to specific user groups entitled 
to information pursuant to Sections (a) through (i) of Section 3.0. Section 3.0 is not intended, however, to 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
add to or vary the criteria specified above. Otherwise, except as specifically provided herein, no other 
distribution or disclosure of Confidential Information shall be permitted by the ISO, Stakeholder 
Committees or Governance Participants.  
 
2.2  
Treatment of Confidential Information  
The Governance Participants shall take reasonable measures to assure that all of their employees, 
representatives, or agents who by virtue of their participation on, or as an alternate on, a Stakeholder 
Committee have access to Confidential Information of another entity that furnished the information, 
including, as appropriate, a Furnishing Governance Participant, a DR Information Provider or the ISO 
(the “Furnishing Entity”) (1) do not disclose such Confidential Information to any other employee, 
representative, or agent of the same Governance Participant or any other person except as permitted under 
this Section 2.2 and (2) use such information solely for the purpose of satisfying that person’s 
responsibilities on the Stakeholder Committee. Each Governance Participant shall, upon request by the 
Participants Committee, provide assurance that the terms of this Section 2.2 are complied with. Any 
Governance Participant that has furnished Confidential Information to Stakeholder Committees may 
require each recipient to return all or any portion of the Confidential Information once it is no longer 
needed by such recipient to fulfill its responsibilities under the Filed Documents.  
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ISO, the Participants Committee or any Governance Participant may 
disclose Confidential Information of another Governance Participant or the ISO only: (1) if such 
disclosure is permitted in writing by the Furnishing Entity, DR Information Provider or the ISO, as the 
case may be, or (2) if disclosure is required by order of a court or regulatory agency of competent 
jurisdiction or dispute resolution pursuant to the Filed Documents, or (3) as otherwise specifically 
permitted by this Policy. Any entity subject to this Information Policy shall provide prompt written notice 
to the Furnishing Entity if that entity either is compelled by order of a court or regulatory agency of 
competent jurisdiction to disclose, or receives a request seeking to compel disclosure of, Confidential 
Information for which it is not the Furnishing Entity. Further, in recognition that certain Governance 
Participants are subject to public records and open meeting laws and that certain other demands may be 
placed on Governance Participants to disclose Confidential Information, a recipient of Confidential 
Information of another Governance Participant or the ISO may disclose such Confidential Information if 
and to the extent required by law or requested in writing pursuant to a public records demand or other 
legal discovery process, provided in either event that the disclosing Governance Participant gives the 
Furnishing Governance Participant or the ISO prompt written notice of the circumstances that may 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
require such disclosure in time so that the Furnishing Governance Participant or the ISO has a reasonable 
opportunity to seek a protective order to prevent disclosure.  
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.2, the ISO, the Participants 
Committee, or any Governance Participant may disclose Confidential Information to an alternate dispute 
resolution (“ADR”) neutral in an ADR proceeding required or permitted by any New England market 
rule, including Appendix A, “Market Monitoring, Reporting and Market Power Mitigation,” to Market 
Rule 1, or to an arbitrator in an arbitration proceeding under the Filed Documents. In addition, the ISO or 
any Governance Participant may disclose Confidential Information to a Dispute Representative as defined 
in, and permitted by, Section 5 of the Billing Policy. Any such ADR neutral, arbitrator or Dispute 
Representative must agree to be bound by this Information Policy.  
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Information Policy, resource-specific information 
contained in the data fields of the Forward Capacity Tracking System, but not information provided to the 
ISO as separate attachments via the Forward Capacity Tracking System, will be shared with subsequent 
Lead Market Participants or Project Sponsors for that resource.  
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ISO New England Information Policy, the ISO, the 
Participants Committee, or any Governance Participant may disclose Confidential Information as required 
or permitted to satisfy the “Minimum Criteria for Market Participation” set forth in Section II.A of the 
ISO New England Financial Assurance Policy. 
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ISO New England Information Policy and consistent with 
the Commission’s Order No. 787, the ISO may disclose Confidential Information concerning natural gas-
fueled generation from resources located within the New England Control Area to the operating personnel 
of an interstate natural gas pipeline company that operates a pipeline provided that: (a) Confidential 
Information regarding specific generators will be shared only with the pipeline serving that generator 
directly and (b) the ISO has determined that it is operationally necessary to ensure reliability to disclose 
the Confidential Information.  
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ISO New England Information Policy and consistent with 
the Commission’s Order No. 895, the ISO may disclose Confidential Information relating to the 
creditworthiness of a Market Participant, a Non-Market Participant Transmission Customer, or an 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Applicant to an Other RTO/ISO, including without limitation information of the respective Affiliates of 
the foregoing, for the purpose of credit risk management and mitigation.  
 
2.3  
Disclosure of Information Regarding Defaulting Governance Participants  
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the information for release to Governance 
Participants identified in this Section shall no longer be deemed “Confidential Information” pursuant to 
the Information Policy. For any Governance Participant that is the subject of a voluntary or involuntary 
bankruptcy petition or has sought relief under bankruptcy or insolvency laws, or that has a Financial 
Assurance Default (as defined in the Financial Assurance Policy) or payment default under the Billing 
Policy, which default is not, or the ISO reasonably concludes will not be, cured within five days of the 
date of the default, in the case of a payment default (as described in the Billing Policy) or within ten days 
of the date of a Financial Assurance Default, the following information with respect to that Governance 
Participant’s obligations shall be disclosed by the ISO to each member and alternate on the Participants 
Committee, each member and alternate on the Budget and Finance Subcommittee, each Governance 
Participant’s billing contacts and financial assurance contacts, appropriate Stakeholder Committee(s) 
designated by the Participants Committee, and appropriate state regulatory or judiciary authority:  
 
For the period beginning 90 calendar days prior to the date of the bankruptcy or insolvency 
petition or for the period beginning on the date of the payment default under the Billing Policy or 
Financial Assurance Default forward until such time as (a) when the Governance Participant 
cures the default (unless otherwise required by this Section 2.3 to be disclosed in connection with 
a bankruptcy or insolvency petition); (b) the earliest to occur of the following: when the 
bankruptcy case is dismissed, the bankruptcy case is closed, or the plan of liquidation, plan of 
reorganization, or plan of adjustment filed in the bankruptcy case has been confirmed and such 
plan has become effective (unless otherwise required by this Section 2.3 to be disclosed in 
connection with a Financial Assurance Default or a payment default under the Billing Policy); or 
(c) in any event, when the Governance Participant’s status with the ISO has been terminated 
(whether voluntarily or involuntarily): (i) the type and available amount of financial assurance in 
place on the date of disclosure; (ii) whether such Governance Participant has defaulted on its 
obligations under the Financial Assurance Policy, the amount of any such default as of the date of 
the disclosure, the date of the initial default, and when or whether the default is cured; (iii) 
whether such Governance Participant has defaulted on its payment obligations under the Billing 
Policy, the cumulative amount of any payment defaults as of the date of disclosure, the initial date 
of the default, the amount of default that remains outstanding as of the date of disclosure, when or 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
whether the default is cured, and the billing default procedures that have been applied pursuant to 
Sections 3.3, 3.4, or 3.6 of the Billing Policy;  
(iv) for any Governance Participant subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency petition, the net 
invoiced amount of such Governance Participant’s purchases in the New England Markets; and 
(v) whether such Governance Participant owns a registered Load Asset.  
 
If a Governance Participant is suspended from the New England Markets, the ISO shall promptly send 
notice of such suspension to each of the members and alternates on the Participants Committee, the 
energy regulatory agencies in each of the New England states and the Commission. Said notice shall 
identify the specific date and time of the suspension.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice of such 
suspension shall not be sent to the Commission if the Governance Participant cures the default related to 
such suspension prior to the end of the next Business Day following the default.  If the ISO has issued a 
notice to the Commission that a Governance Participant has been suspended, and that Governance 
Participant subsequently cures and is no longer suspended (as determined by the ISO in its sole 
discretion), such Governance Participant may request the ISO to issue a notice state such fact.  In the 
event of a Financial Assurance Default (as defined in the Financial Assurance Policy) or payment default 
under the Billing Policy, the ISO may, to the extent reasonably necessary, disclose “Confidential 
Information” related to such Financial Assurance Default or payment default in any proceeding before the 
Commission or a court or agency of competent jurisdiction. 
 
2.4  
Breach of Confidential Information Obligations  
The Governance Participants and the ISO acknowledge that remedies at law for any breach of the 
obligations under this Section 2 would be inadequate and agree that, in enforcing this Section 2, in 
addition to any other remedies provided at law:  
 
(a)  
A Furnishing Governance Participant may, at its option, take one or both of the following actions: 
(i) apply to any court of equity having jurisdiction for an injunction restraining the ISO, any 
Stakeholder Committee or any Governance Participant from an actual or threatened violation of 
this Section 2 relating to Confidential Information provided by such Furnishing Governance 
Participant and (ii) submit such actual or threatened violation to arbitration in accordance with the 
procedure provided in Section 17.3 of the Participants Agreement and Section I of the 
Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
(b)  
The ISO may, at its option, take one or both of the following actions: (i) apply to any court of 
equity having jurisdiction for an injunction restraining a Governance Participant or any 
Stakeholder Committee from an actual or threatened violation of this Section 2 relating to 
Confidential Information and (ii) submit such actual or threatened violation to arbitration in 
accordance with the procedure provided in Section 17.3 of the Participants Agreement and 
Section I of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff.  
 
(c)  
The Participants Committee may, at its option, take one or both of the following actions: (i) apply 
to any court of equity having jurisdiction for an injunction restraining the ISO from an actual or 
threatened violation of this Section 2 relating to Confidential Information and (ii) submit such 
actual or threatened violation to arbitration in accordance with the procedure provided in Section 
17.3 of the Participants Agreement and Section I of the Transmission, Markets and Services 
Tariff.

(Y) the Requesting Entity is a member of a user group specifically entitled to receive such 
information pursuant to Sections (a) through (i) of Section 3.0. If the ISO determines that the 
Requesting Entity is not entitled to receive the requested information pursuant to Sections (a) 
through (i) of Section 3.0, the ISO shall then determine if the requested information is 
Confidential Information or Strategic Information. The ISO may consult with the Independent 
Market Advisor, NEPOOL counsel, the Furnishing Entity(ies), and/or the Participants Committee 
(as provided in Section 3.1(d)) during the process of making this determination.  
 
(A)  
If the ISO determines that the information is Confidential Information, the ISO 
Information Contact will refer the request to the Furnishing Entity(ies) and the ISO will 
not release the requested information unless it is directed to do so by the Furnishing 
Entity(ies) or ordered to do so by a court or regulatory authority with jurisdiction over 
such matters. If the Furnishing Entity(ies) directs the ISO to release the requested 
information, the ISO will next determine whether the requested information is Strategic 
Information as set forth in Section 3.1(c)(i)(B) below. The Furnishing Entity(ies) shall 
bear any costs reasonably incurred by the ISO in opposing the issuance of such an order 
requiring disclosure of the Furnishing Entity(ies)’ Confidential Information. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the request of a regulatory agency, other than FERC 
or its staff or the CFTC or its staff, having appropriate jurisdiction and subject to an 
appropriate confidentiality order entered under such agency’s procedures sufficient to 
preserve the confidential nature of the information submitted, and with advance notice to 
the Furnishing Entity(ies), the ISO Information Contact may submit Confidential 
Information to such agency.  
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
 
(B)  
If the information requested is Strategic Information, the ISO shall determine 
whether to release the requested information, in consultation with the Independent 
Market Advisor, NEPOOL counsel and/or the Furnishing Entity(ies), as the ISO deems 
appropriate. If the ISO releases such information, it will do so by making the information 
public.  
 
(C)  
If the information requested is neither Confidential Information nor Strategic 
Information, the ISO shall determine whether to release the requested information; 
provided that the Participants Committee, acting on the recommendation of an 
appropriate Stakeholder Committee, may request the ISO to release the requested 
information.  
 
(ii)  
If, after consultation with the Independent Market Advisor, NEPOOL counsel and/or the 
Furnishing Entity, as appropriate, the ISO cannot, in its good faith judgment, determine the 
classification status of requested information or otherwise believes that a Formal Information 
Request raises policy questions that should be determined by the Governance Participants, then 
the following procedure shall apply:  
 
(A)  
The ISO shall refer the request to the Participants Committee with its 
recommendation for action.  
 
(B)  
The Participants Committee, acting on recommendation of a subcommittee or 
working group, as appropriate, may approve of or suggest modifications to the 
recommendation of the ISO. If the Participants Committee approves the ISO’s 
recommendation, or if the ISO accepts the Participants Committee’s suggested 
modifications, the Participants Committee’s decision shall determine the response to the 
Formal Information Request; provided, however, that, to the extent that the information 
requested is found to be Confidential Information, the ISO shall continue to maintain the 
confidentiality of such information in accordance with the terms of this Information 
Policy.  
 
(g) 
 Release of Information; Prioritization of Formal Information Requests  
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
(i)  
The ISO shall reasonably attempt to comply with any Formal Information Request that 
has been granted within thirty (30) days of the Initial Response or Follow-Up Response informing 
the Requesting Entity that its request has been granted. The ISO may condition the release of any 
information to a Requesting Entity upon payment of the ISO’s reasonable cost to identify and 
prepare such information.  
 
 (ii)  
If the ISO does not have the resources available to comply with all outstanding Formal 
Information Requests within the time provided in clause (i) above, the ISO will consult with the 
Participants Committee or its designated subcommittee or working group to determine how such 
Formal Information Requests should be prioritized.  
 
(h)

Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
 
(3)  
The Authorized Commission employing or retaining the Authorized Person has 
provided the ISO with a State Certification.  
 
(4)  
The ISO and the External Market Monitor shall be expressly entitled to rely upon 
such Commission and Authorized Commission orders, the State Certification and/or 
certifications of counsel in providing Confidential Market Information to the Authorized 
Person, and shall in no event be liable, or subject to damages or claims of any kind or 
nature hereunder due to the ineffectiveness of the /Commission and/or Authorized 
Commission orders, or the inaccuracy of such certification of counsel.  
 
(5)  
The Authorized Person may discuss Confidential Market Information with other 
Authorized Persons who are parties to Non-Disclosure Agreements, provided; however, 
that the ISO shall have confirmed in advance and in writing that it has previously 
released the Confidential Market Information in question to such Authorized Persons.  
The ISO shall respond to any written request for confirmation within two (2) business 
days of its receipt.  
 
(6) 
 The ISO shall maintain a schedule of all Authorized Persons and the Authorized 
Commissions they represent, which shall be made publicly available on the ISO’s 
website or by written request. Such schedule shall be compiled by the ISO, based on 
information provided by any Authorized Person and/or Authorized Commission.  The 
ISO shall update the schedule promptly upon receipt of information from an Authorized 
Person or Authorized Commission, but shall have no obligation to verify or corroborate 
any such information, and shall not be liable or otherwise responsible for any 
inaccuracies in the schedule due to incomplete or erroneous information conveyed to and 
relied upon by the ISO in the compilation and/or maintenance of the schedule.  
 
(ii)  
The External Market Monitor or other designated representative of the ISO may, in the 
course of discussions with any Authorized Person, orally disclose information otherwise required 
to be maintained in confidence, without the need for a prior Information Request.  Such oral 
disclosures shall provide enough information to enable the Authorized Person or their Authorized 
Commission to determine whether additional Information Requests for information are 
appropriate. The External Market Monitor or other representative of the ISO will not make any 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
written or electronic disclosures of Confidential Market Information to the Authorized Person 
pursuant to this section. In any such discussions, the External Market Monitor or other 
representative of the ISO shall ensure that the individual or individuals receiving such 
Confidential Market Information are Authorized Persons as defined herein, request that the 
Authorized Person describe the purpose of the inquiry, orally designate Confidential Market 
Information that is disclosed, and refrain from identifying any specific Affected Governance 
Participant whose information is disclosed.  The External Market Monitor or other representative 
of the ISO shall also be authorized to assist Authorized Persons in interpreting Confidential 
Market Information that is disclosed.  The External Market Monitor or representative of the ISO 
shall provide any Affected Governance Participant and counsel for the Participants Committee 
with oral notice of any oral disclosure immediately, but not later than one (1) business day after 
the oral disclosure.  Such oral notice to the Affected Governance Participant shall include the 
substance of the oral disclosure, but shall not reveal any Confidential Market Information of any 
other Governance Participant and must be received by the Affected Governance Participant 
before the name of the Affected Governance Participant is released to the Authorized Person, 
provided; however, the identity of the Affected Party must be made to the Authorized Person 
within two (2) business days of the initial oral disclosure.  The ISO shall provide an Affected 
Governance Participant and counsel for the Participants Committee with written notice, which 
shall include electronic communication, of any oral disclosure as soon as possible, but not later 
than two (2) business days after the date of the oral disclosure.  
 
(iii)  
As regards Information Requests:  
 
(1) 
 Information Requests to the ISO shall be in writing, which shall include 
electronic communications addressed to the External Market Monitor or other designated 
representative of the ISO, and shall: (a) describe with particularity the information 
sought; (b) provide a description of the purpose of the Information Request; (c) state the 
time period for which Confidential Market Information is requested; and (d) re-affirm 
that only the Authorized Person shall have access to the Confidential Market Information 
requested.  The ISO shall provide an Affected Governance Participant and counsel for the 
Participants Committee with written notice, which shall include electronic 
communication, of an Information Request of the Authorized Person as soon as possible, 
but not later than two (2) business days after the receipt of the Information Request.  
 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
(2)  
Subject to the provisions of section (iii)(3), the ISO shall supply Confidential 
Market Information to the Authorized Person in response to any Information Request 
within five (5) business days of the receipt of the Information Request, to the extent that 
the requested Confidential Market Information can be made available within such period, 
provided; however, that in no event shall Confidential Market Information be released 
prior to the end of the fourth (4th) business day without the express consent of the 
Affected Governance Participant. To the extent that the ISO cannot reasonably prepare 
and deliver the requested Confidential Market Information within such five (5) day 
period, it shall, within such period, provide the Authorized Person with a written schedule 
for the provision of such remaining Confidential Market Information.  Upon providing 
Confidential Market Information to the Authorized Person, the ISO shall either provide a 
copy of the Confidential Market Information to the Affected Governance Participant(s), 
or provide a listing of the Confidential Market Information disclosed, provided; however, 
that the ISO shall not reveal any Governance Participant’s Confidential Market 
Information to any other Governance Participant.  
 
(3)  
Notwithstanding section (iii)(2), above, should the ISO, an Affected Governance 
Participant, or the Participants Committee (with respect to an Information Request that 
applies to multiple Governance Participants) object to an Information Request or any 
portion thereof, any of them may, within four (4) business days following the ISO’s 
receipt of the Information Request, request, in writing, a conference with the Authorized 
Commission or the Authorized Commission’s authorized designee to resolve differences 
concerning the scope or timing of the Information Request, provided; however, nothing 
herein shall require the Authorized Commission to participate in any conference.  Any 
party to the conference may seek assistance from the Commission staff in resolution of 
the dispute.  Should such conference be refused by any participant, or not resolve the 
dispute, then the ISO, the Affected Governance Participant, the Participants Committee 
(with respect to an Information Request that applies to multiple Governance Participants) 
or the Authorized Commission may initiate appropriate legal action at the Commission 
within three (3) business days following receipt of written notice from any conference 
participant terminating such conference. Any complaints filed at the Commission 
objecting to a particular Information Request shall be designated by the party as a “fast 
track” complaint and each party shall bear its own costs in connection with such 
Commission proceeding. If no Commission proceeding regarding the Information 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Request is commenced within such three day period, the ISO shall utilize its best efforts 
to respond to the Information Request promptly. During any pending Commission 
proceeding regarding an Information Request, the ISO shall continue to maintain the 
confidentiality of the Confidential Market Information subject to such Information 
Request.  
 
(iv)  
In the event of any breach of a Non-Disclosure Agreement:  
 
(1)  
The Authorized Person and/or their respective Authorized Commission shall 
promptly notify the ISO, who shall, in turn, promptly notify any Affected Governance 
Participant and counsel for the Participants Committee of any inadvertent or intentional 
release, or possible release, of Confidential Market Information provided pursuant to any 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.  
 
(2)  
The ISO shall terminate such Non-Disclosure Agreement upon written notice to 
the Authorized Person and his or her Authorized Commission, and all rights of the 
Authorized Person thereunder shall thereupon terminate, provided; however, that the ISO 
may restore an individual’s status as an Authorized Person after consulting with the 
Affected Governance Participant and to the extent that: (i) the ISO determines that the 
disclosure was not due to the intentional, reckless or negligent action or omission of the 
Authorized Person; (ii) there were no harm or damage suffered by the Affected 
Governance Participant; or (iii) similar good cause shown. Any appeal of the ISO’s 
actions under this section shall be to the Commission.  
 
(3)  
The ISO, the Affected Governance Participant, and/or the Participants 
Committee shall have the right to seek and obtain at least the following types of relief: (a) 
an order from the Commission requiring any breach to cease and preventing any future 
breaches; (b) temporary, preliminary, and/or permanent injunctive relief with respect to 
any breach; and (c) the immediate return of all Confidential Market Information to the 
ISO.  
 
(4)  
No Authorized Person shall have responsibility or liability whatsoever under the 
Non-Disclosure Agreement or this Information Policy for any and all liabilities, losses, 
damages, demands, fines, monetary judgments, penalties, costs and expenses caused by, 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
resulting from, or arising out of or in connection with the release of Confidential Market 
Information to persons not authorized to receive it, provided that such Authorized Person 
is an employee or member of an Authorized Commission at the time of such 
unauthorized release. Nothing in this section (iv)(4) is intended to limit the liability of 
any person who is not an employee of or a member of an Authorized Commission at the, 
time of such unauthorized release for any and all economic losses, damages, demands, 
fines, monetary judgments, penalties, costs and expenses caused by, resulting from, or 
arising out of or in connection with such unauthorized release.  
 
(5) 
 Any dispute or conflict requesting the relief in section (iv)(2) or (iv)(3)(a) above, 
shall be submitted to the Commission for hearing and resolution.  Any dispute or conflict 
requesting the relief in section (4)(3)(c) above may be submitted to the Commission or 
any court of competent jurisdiction for hearing and resolution.  
 
(c) 
Procedures for Disclosures to an ISO/MMU Requesting Entity 
(i) 
Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the ISO, the Internal Market 
Monitor or the External Market Monitor shall disclose Confidential Market Information, 
otherwise required to be maintained in confidence pursuant to this Information Policy, to an 
ISO/MMU Requesting Entity under the following conditions: 
 
(1) The ISO/MMU Requesting Entity has submitted to the ISO a written request for the 
disclosure of Confidential Market Information. 
 
(2) The written request explains why the requested Confidential Market Information is 
necessary to an investigation that the ISO/MMU Requesting Entity is undertaking 
pursuant to its tariff, other governing documents, or an applicable law or regulation to 
determine (a) if a Market Violation is occurring or has occurred, (b) if market power 
is being or has been exercised, or (c) if a market design flaw exists that affects either 
the New England markets or the markets administered by the ISO/MMU Requesting 
Entity. 
 
(3) The written request either (x) demonstrates, by providing copies of the relevant 
documentation, that the ISO/MMU Requesting Entity’s tariff or other governing 
document limits further disclosure of the Confidential Market Information in a 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
manner that satisfies all of the requirements set forth in Section 3.3(c)(ii) below, or 
(y) is accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement, which has been executed by both 
the ISO/MMU Requesting Entity and the ISO, that incorporates all of the 
requirements in Section 3.3(c)(ii) below, and a written certification that the 
ISO/MMU Requesting Entity possesses the legal authority to enter into the non-
disclosure agreement, to be bound by it, and to perform all of the obligations of the 
non-disclosure agreement. 
 
(4) If the ISO/MMU Requesting Entity is an independent system operator or regional 
transmission organization that meets the conditions in this Section 3.3(c), then the 
ISO shall also disclose the requested Confidential Market Information to the 
ISO/MMU Requesting Entity’s market monitor, on condition that the receiving 
market monitor satisfy the confidentiality requirements and obligations specified in 
Section 3.3(c)(i)(3) above. 
 
(ii) 
The ISO/MMU Requesting Entity’s governing documents or non-disclosure agreement 
must: 
(1) Covenant and agree not to disclose and to protect from disclosure the Confidential

compulsory process; 
 
(2)  Represent and warrant that the ISO/MMU Requesting Entity has adequate 
procedures to protect against the release of Confidential Market Information; 
 
 
(3) Establish a legally enforceable obligation to treat Confidential Market Information as

(4) Require that the ISO/MMU Requesting Entity use the Confidential Market 
Information solely for the purpose of investigating (a) if a Market Violation is 
occurring or has occurred, (b) if market power is being or has been exercised, or (c) if 
a market design flaw exists that affects either the New England markets or the 
markets administered by the ISO/MMU Requesting Entity; 
 
(5) Require state commissions to request Confidential Market Information directly from 
the ISO or the Internal Market Monitor, in a manner consistent with Section 3.3(b) of 
this Information Policy, and promptly inform the ISO or the Internal Market Monitor 
of any request received from a state commission for Confidential Market 
Information;

(c) in the event a protective order or other remedy is denied, to furnish only that 
portion of the Confidential Market Information which its legal counsel advises the 
ISO, the Internal Market Monitor or the External Market Monitor in writing is legally 
required to be furnished, and to exercise its best efforts to obtain assurance that 
confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Market Information; 
 
(7) Require the ISO/MMU Requesting Entity to promptly notify the ISO, the Internal 
Market Monitor or the External Market Monitor of any Third Party Requests for 
additional disclosure of the Confidential Market Information where Confidential 
Market Information has been disclosed to a court or regulatory body in response to a 
subpoena or other compulsory process, and to seek appropriate relief to prevent or 
limit further disclosure; 
 
(8)  Require destruction of the Confidential Market Information at the earlier of (a)

Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
External Market Monitor for the return of the Confidential Market Information is 
received, or (b) the conclusion or resolution of the investigation.

this Agreement.  
 
2.2  
Conditions Precedent. As a condition of the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this 
Agreement by ISO and the continued provision of Confidential Market Information pursuant to the terms 
of this Agreement, the Authorized Commission shall, prior to the initial oral or written request for 
Confidential Market Information by an Authorized Person on its behalf, provide ISO with: (a) a final 
order of FERC prohibiting the release by the Authorized Person or the State Commission of Confidential 
Market Information in accordance with the terms of the Operating Agreement and this Agreement; and 
(b) either an order of the State Commission or a certification from counsel to the State Commission, 
confirming that the State Commission has statutory authority to protect the confidentiality of the

Information; and (c) confirmation in writing that the Authorized Person is authorized by the State 
Commission to enter into this Agreement and to receive Confidential Market Information under the ISO 
New England Information Policy.  
 
2.3 
 Discussion of Confidential Market Information with other Authorized Persons.  The 
Authorized Person may discuss Confidential Market Information with other Authorized Persons who 
have executed non-disclosure agreements with ISO containing the same terms and conditions as this 
Agreement; provided, however, that ISO shall have confirmed in advance and in writing that ISO has 
previously released the Confidential Market Information in question to such Authorized Persons. ISO 
shall respond to any written request for confirmation within two (2) business days of its receipt.  
 
2.4 
 Defense Against Third Party Requests.  The Authorized Person shall defend against any 
disclosure of Confidential Market Information pursuant to any Third Party Request through all available 
legal process, including, but not limited to, obtaining any necessary protective orders. The Authorized 
Person shall provide ISO, and ISO shall provide each Affected Governance Participant and counsel for 
the Participants Committee, with prompt notice of any such Third Party Request or legal proceedings, and 
shall consult with ISO and/or any Affected Governance Participant in its efforts to deny the request or 
defend against such legal process.  In the event a protective order or other remedy is denied, the 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Authorized Person agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Market Information which their 
legal counsel advises ISO (and of which ISO shall, in turn, advise any Affected Governance Participants) 
in writing is legally required to be furnished, and to exercise their best efforts to obtain assurance that 
confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Market Information.  
 
2.5  
Care and Use of Confidential Market Information.  
 
2.5.1  Control of Confidential Market Information. The Authorized Person(s) shall be the 
custodian(s) of any and all Confidential Market Information received pursuant to the terms of this 
Agreement from ISO or the External Market Monitor.  
 
2.5.2  Access to Confidential Market Information. The Authorized Person shall ensure that 
Confidential Market Information received by that Authorized Person is disseminated only to those 
persons publicly identified as Authorized Persons on Exhibit “A” to the certification provided by the State 
Commission pursuant to the procedures contained in Section 2.2 of this Agreement.  
 
2.5.3  Schedule of  Authorized Persons. 
(i)  
The Authorized Person shall promptly notify ISO of any change that would affect the 
Authorized Person’s status as an Authorized Person, and in such event shall request, in writing, 
deletion from the schedule referred to in section (ii), below.  
 
(ii)  
ISO shall maintain a schedule of all Authorized Persons and the Authorized Commissions 
they represent, which shall be made publicly available on ISO’s website and/or by written 
request. Such schedule shall be compiled by ISO, based on information provided by any 
Authorized Person and/or Authorized Commission. ISO shall update the schedule promptly upon 
receipt of information from an Authorized Person or Authorized Commission, but shall have no 
obligation to verify or corroborate any such information, and shall not be liable or otherwise 
responsible for any inaccuracies in the schedule due to incomplete or erroneous information 
conveyed to and relied upon by ISO in the compilation and/or maintenance of the schedule.  
 
2.5.4 
Use of Confidential Market Information. The Authorized Person and his or her Authorized 
Commission shall use the Confidential Market Information solely for the purpose of assisting the 
Authorized Commission in discharging its legal responsibility to monitor the wholesale and retail 
electricity markets, operations, transmission planning and siting, and generation planning and siting 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
materially affecting retail customers within the State in which the Authorized Commission has regulatory 
jurisdiction, and for no other purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, the Authorized Person and his or 
her Authorized Commission shall not use its right to acquire Confidential Market Information as a means 
of conducting discovery or providing evidence during an adversarial proceeding against an Affected 
Governance Participant or any group of Participants. The Authorized Person and his or her Authorized 
Commission, however, shall not be prevented from using in an adversarial proceeding Confidential 
Market Information the Authorized Commission has obtained if: (i) such information becomes known in 
that proceeding through disclosure by entities other than the Authorized Commission; and (ii) the 
Authorized Commission discloses such Confidential Market Information consistent with the protections 
and procedures governing the disclosure of Confidential Market Information to parties in that proceeding; 
or (iii) the information being disclosed no longer meets the definition of Confidential Market Information. 
 
2.5.5  Return of Confidential Market Information.  Upon completion of the inquiry or investigation 
referred to in the Information Request, or for any reason the Authorized Person is, or will no longer be an 
Authorized Person, the Authorized Person shall (a) return the Confidential Market Information and all 
copies thereof to ISO, or (b) provide a certification that the Authorized Person has destroyed all paper 
copies and deleted all electronic copies of the Confidential Market Information, unless such actions are 
inconsistent with or prohibited by applicable state law, in which case the Authorized Person shall 
continue to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Market Information in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of this Agreement.  ISO may waive this condition in writing if such Confidential 
Market Information has become publicly available or non-confidential in the course of business or 
pursuant to the ISO Tariff or order of the Commission.  
 
2.5.6  Notice of Disclosures. The Authorized Person, directly or through the Authorized Commission, 
shall promptly notify ISO, and ISO shall promptly notify any Affected Governance Participant, of any 
inadvertent or intentional release or possible release of the Confidential Market Information provided 
pursuant to this Agreement.  The Authorized Person shall take all steps to minimize any further release of 
Confidential Market Information, and shall take reasonable steps to attempt to retrieve any Confidential 
Market Information that may have been released.  
 
2.6  
Ownership and Privilege.  Nothing in this Agreement, or incident to the provision of 
Confidential Market Information to the Authorized Person pursuant to any Information Request, is 
intended, nor shall it be deemed, to be a waiver or abandonment of any legal privilege that may be 
asserted against, subsequent disclosure or discovery in any formal proceeding or investigation.  Moreover, 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
no transfer or creation of ownership rights in any intellectual property comprising Confidential Market 
Information is intended or shall be inferred by the disclosure of Confidential Market Information by ISO, 
and any and all intellectual property comprising Confidential Market Information disclosed and any 
derivations thereof shall continue to be the exclusive intellectual property of ISO and/or the Affected 
Governance Participant.  
 
3. 
 Procedure for Information Requests  
 
3.1  
Written Requests.  Information Requests to ISO shall be in writing, which shall include 
electronic communications, addressed to the External Market Monitor or other ISO representatives as 
specified by ISO, with a concurrent copy to ISO’s General Counsel, and shall: (a) describe with 
particularity the information sought; (b) provide a description of the purpose of the Information Request; 
(c) state the  time period for which information is requested; and (d) re-affirm that only the Authorized 
Person shall have access to the Confidential Market Information requested. ISO shall provide an Affected 
Governance Participant and counsel for the Participants Committee with written notice, which shall 
include electronic communication, of an Information Request of the Authorized Person as soon as 
possible, but not later than two (2) business days after the receipt of the Information Request.  
 
3.2  
Oral Disclosures by the External Market Monitor.  The External Market Monitor or other ISO 
representatives as specified by ISO may, in the course of discussions with an Authorized Person, orally 
disclose information otherwise required to be maintained in confidence, without the need for a prior 
Information Request.  Such oral disclosures shall provide enough information to enable the Authorized 
Person or the State Commission to determine whether additional Information Requests for information 
are appropriate.  The External Market Monitor or other ISO representative will not make any written or 
electronic disclosures of Confidential Market Information to the Authorized Person pursuant to this 
section.  In any such discussions, the External Market Monitor or other ISO representative shall ensure 
that the individual or individuals receiving such Confidential Market Information are Authorized Persons 
under this Agreement, request that the Authorized Person describe the purpose of the inquiry, orally 
designate Confidential Market Information that is disclosed and refrain from identifying any specific 
Affected Governance Participant whose information is disclosed. The External Market Monitor or other 
ISO representative shall also be authorized to assist Authorized Persons in interpreting Confidential 
Market Information that is disclosed.  ISO or the External Market Monitor shall (i) maintain a written 
record of oral disclosures pursuant to this section, which shall include the date of each oral disclosure and 
the Confidential Market Information disclosed in each such oral disclosure, and (ii) provide any Affected 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Governance Participant and counsel for the Participants Committee with oral notice of any oral disclosure 
immediately, but not later than one (1) business day after the oral disclosure. Such oral notice to the 
Affected Governance Participant shall include the substance of the oral disclosure, but shall not reveal 
any Confidential Market Information of any other Governance Participant and must be received by the 
Affected Governance Participant before the name of the Affected Governance Participant is released to 
the Authorized Person; provided however, the identity of the Affected Party must be made available to 
the Authorized Person within two (2) business days of the initial oral disclosure.  ISO shall provide an 
Affected Governance Participant and counsel for the Participants Committee with written notice, which 
shall include electronic communication, of any oral disclosure as soon as possible, but not later than two 
(2) business days after the date of the initial oral disclosure.  
 
3.3  
Response to Information Requests.  
 
3.3.1 
Subject to the provisions of Section 3.3.2 below, ISO shall supply Confidential Market 
Information to the Authorized Person in response to any Information Request within five (5) business 
days of the receipt of the Information Request, to the extent that the requested Confidential Market 
Information can be made available within such period; provided however, that in no event shall 
Confidential Market Information be released prior to the end of the fourth (4th) business day without the 
express consent of the Affected Governance Participant. To the extent that ISO can not reasonably 
prepare and deliver the requested Confidential Market Information within such five (5) day period, ISO 
shall, within such period, provide the Authorized Person with a written schedule for the provision of such 
remaining Confidential Market Information. Upon providing Confidential Market Information to the 
Authorized Person, ISO shall either provide a copy of the Confidential Market Information to the 
Affected Governance Participant(s), or provide a listing of the Confidential Market Information disclosed; 
provided, however, that ISO shall not reveal any Governance Participant’s Confidential Market 
Information to any other Governance Participant.  
 
3.3.2 
Notwithstanding section 3.3.1, above, should ISO or an Affected Governance Participant or the 
Participants Committee (with respect to an Information Request that applies to multiple Governance 
Participants) object to an Information Request or any portion thereof, ISO, the Affected Governance 
Participant and/or the Participants Committee may, within four (4) business days following ISO’s receipt 
of the Information Request, request, in writing (which shall include electronic communication) addressed 
to the State Commission with a copy to either the Affected Governance Participant, ISO and/or counsel to 
the Participants Committee, as the case may be, a conference with the State Commission or the State 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Commission’s authorized designee to resolve differences concerning the scope or timing of the 
Information Request; provided, however, nothing herein shall require the State Commission to participate 
in any conference. Any party to the conference may seek assistance from the Commission staff in 
resolution of the dispute. Should such conference be refused by any participant, or not resolve the dispute, 
then ISO, the Affected Governance Participant, the Participants Committee (with respect to an 
Information Request that applies to multiple Governance Participants) or the State Commission may 
initiate appropriate legal action at the Commission within three (3) business days following receipt of 
written notice from any conference participant terminating such conference. Any complaints filed at the 
Commission objecting to a particular Information Request shall be designated by the party as a “fast 
track” complaint and each party shall bear its own costs in connection with such Commission proceeding. 
If no Commission proceeding regarding the Information Request is commenced by ISO, the Affected 
Governance Participant or the State Commission within such three day period, ISO shall utilize its best 
efforts to respond to the Information Request promptly. During any pending Commission proceeding 
regarding an Information Request, ISO shall continue to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential 
Market Information subject to such Information Request.  
 
3.3.3  To the extent that a response to any Information Request requires disclosure of Confidential 
Market Information of two or more Affected Governance Participants, ISO shall, to the extent possible, 
segregate such information and respond to the Information Request separately for each Affected 
Governance Participant.  
 
4.  
Remedies.  
 
4.1  
Material Breach. The Authorized Person agrees that release of Confidential Market Information 
to persons not authorized to receive it constitutes a breach of this Agreement and may cause irreparable 
harm to ISO and/or the Affected Governance Participant. In the event of a breach of this Agreement by 
the Authorized Person, ISO shall terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Authorized Person 
and his or her Authorized Commission, and all rights of the Authorized Person hereunder shall thereupon 
terminate; provided, however, that ISO may restore an individual’s status as an Authorized Person after 
consulting with the Affected Governance Participant and to the extent that: (i) ISO determines that the 
disclosure was not due to the intentional, reckless or negligent action or omission of the Authorized 
Person; (ii) there were no harm or damages suffered by the Affected Governance Participant; or (iii) 
similar good cause shown. Any appeal of ISO’s actions under this section shall be to the Commission.  
 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
4.2  
Judicial Recourse. In the event of any breach of this Agreement, ISO, the Affected Governance 
Participant and/or the Participants Committee shall have the right to seek and obtain at least the following 
types of relief: (a) an order from the Commission requiring any breach to cease and preventing any future 
breaches; (b) temporary, preliminary, and/or permanent injunctive relief with respect to any breach; and 
(c) the immediate return of all Confidential Market Information to ISO. The Authorized Person expressly 
agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, any relief sought properly includes, but shall not be 
limited to, the immediate return of all Confidential Market Information to ISO.  
 
4.3  
Waiver of Monetary Damages. No Authorized Person shall have responsibility or liability 
whatsoever under this Agreement for any and all liabilities, losses,  
damages, demands, fines, monetary judgments, penalties, costs and expenses caused by, resulting from, or 
arising out of, or in connection with, the release of Confidential Market Information to persons not 
authorized to receive it, provided that such Authorized Person is an employee or Governance Participant 
of an Authorized Commission at the time of such unauthorized release. Nothing in this Section 4.3 is 
intended to limit the liability of any person who is not an employee of or a Governance Participant of an 
Authorized Commission at the time of such unauthorized release for any and all economic losses, 
damages, demands, fines, monetary judgments, penalties, costs and expenses caused by, resulting from, or 
arising out of or in connection with such unauthorized release.  
 
5. 
Jurisdiction. The Parties agree that (i) any dispute or conflict requesting the relief in sections 4.1 
and 4.2(a) above shall be submitted to the Commission for hearing and resolution; (ii) any dispute or 
conflict requesting the relief in section 4.2(c) above may be submitted to the Commission or any court of 
competent jurisdiction for hearing and resolution; and (iii) jurisdiction over all other actions and requested 
relief shall lie in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
 
6.

Severability and Survival. In the event any provision of this Agreement is determined to be 
unenforceable as a matter of law, the Parties intend that all other provisions of this Agreement remain in 
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. In the event of conflicts between the terms of this 
Agreement and the Operating Agreement, the terms of the Operating Agreement shall in all events be 
controlling. The Authorized Person acknowledges that any and all obligations of the Authorized Person 
hereunder shall survive the severance or termination of any employment or retention relationship between 
the Authorized Person and their respective Authorized Commission.

Whereas, the Authorized Commission has designated the individuals on attached Exhibit “A” (the 
“Authorized Persons”) to receive Confidential Market Information from ISO, and  
 
Whereas, the Authorized Persons and ISO have, or will, enter into non-disclosure agreements, governing 
the rights and obligations of the Authorized Persons, ISO and others regarding the Authorized Persons’ 
access to, provision of, use and control of the Confidential Market Information (the “Non-Disclosure 
Agreements”), and  
 
Whereas, as a condition precedent to the execution of the Non-Disclosure Agreements and provision of 
Confidential Market Information to the Authorized Persons, the Authorized Commission is required to

protecting the confidentiality of such data;  
 
Whereas, the Parties desire to set forth those representations and warranties herein.  
 
Now, therefore, the Authorized Commission hereby makes the following representations and warranties, 
all of which shall be true and correct as of the date of execution of this Certification, and at all times 
thereafter, and with the express understanding that ISO and any Affected Member shall rely on each 
representation and/or warranty:

Information pursuant to any Third Party Request through all available legal process, including, but not 
limited to, obtaining any necessary protective orders. The Authorized Commission shall provide ISO with 
prompt notice of any such Third Party Request or legal proceedings, and shall consult with ISO and/or 
any Affected Governance Participant in its efforts to deny the request or defend against such legal 
process. In the event a protective order or other remedy is denied, the Authorized Commission agrees to 
furnish only that portion of the Confidential Market Information which their legal counsel advises ISO 
(and of which ISO shall, in turn, advise any Affected Member) in writing is legally required to be 
furnished, and to exercise then-best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be 
accorded to such Confidential Market Information.

ISO, or (b) provides a certification that the Authorized Person and/or the Authorized Commission 
has destroyed all paper copies and deleted all electronic copies of the Confidential Market 
Information, unless such actions are inconsistent with or prohibited by applicable state law, in 
which case the Authorized Commission shall continue to maintain the confidentiality of the 
Confidential Market Information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this 
Certification.

Protection of Confidentiality.

Duty to Not Disclose. The Authorized Institution represents and warrants that it:  
(i) is duly authorized to enter into and perform this Agreement; (ii) has adequate procedures to protect 
against the release of Confidential Market Information; (iii) is familiar with, and will comply with, all 
such applicable procedures; and (iv) is not in breach of any other Academic Institution Non-Disclosure

this Agreement.  
 
2.2  
Defense Against Third Party Requests.  The Authorized Institution shall defend against any 
disclosure of Confidential Market Information pursuant to any Third Party Request through all available

proceedings, and shall consult with the ISO and/or any Affected Governance Participant in its efforts to 
deny the request or defend against such legal process.  In the event a protective order or other remedy is 
denied, the Authorized Institution agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Market 
Information which its legal counsel advises the ISO (and of which the ISO shall, in turn, advise any 
Affected Governance Participants) in writing is legally required to be furnished, and to exercise its best 
efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Market 
Information.  
 
2.3  
Care and Use of Confidential Market Information.  
 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
2.3.1  Control of Confidential Market Information. The Authorized Institution shall be the custodian 
of any and all Confidential Market Information received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement from the 
ISO or the External Market Monitor.  
 
2.3.2  Access to Confidential Market Information. The Authorized Institution shall ensure that 
Confidential Market Information received by that Authorized Institution is disseminated only to those 
persons publicly identified as Authorized Researchers in the applicable Information Request, and that 
such Authorized Researchers have been advised of the confidential nature of the Confidential Market 
Information and have agreed to abide by the terms of this Agreement by signing a Non-Disclosure 
Certificate.  The Authorized Institution agrees that it shall be liable for any breach of this Agreement by 
any of the Authorized Researchers.  
 
2.3.3  Competitive Duty Personnel. If any person who has been an “Authorized Researcher” 
subsequently becomes Competitive Duty Personnel, that person shall thereafter have no access to 
Confidential Market Information, shall return all such materials to the Authorized Institution, and shall 
continue to comply with the requirements set forth in this Non-Disclosure Agreement with respect to 
Confidential Market Information to which such person previously had access.  
 
2.3.4  Use of Confidential Market Information.  The Authorized Institution shall use the Confidential 
Market Information solely for the purpose of the  Proposed Research. An Authorized Researcher may 
make copies of Confidential Market Information, but such copies become Confidential Market 
Information. An Authorized Researcher may make notes of Confidential Market Information, which shall 
be treated as Notes of Confidential Market Information if they disclose the contents of Confidential 
Market Information. In the event that the Authorized Institution or any Authorized Researcher desires to 
publish any material related to or that relies upon the Confidential Market Information, the Authorized 
Institution or Authorized Researcher must ensure that the Confidential Market Information is sufficiently 
redacted or summarized so that it may not be identified. Any such publication must be approved in 
writing by the ISO in advance of its release.  
 
2.3.5  Return of Confidential Market Information. Upon completion of the Proposed Research, or 
upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Authorized Institution shall (a) return the 
Confidential Market Information and all copies thereof to the ISO, or (b) provide a certification that the 
Authorized Institution has destroyed all paper copies and deleted all electronic copies of the Confidential 
Market Information. The ISO may waive this condition in writing if such Confidential Market 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Information has become publicly available or non-confidential in the course of business or pursuant to the 
ISO Tariff or order of the Commission.  
 
2.3.6  Notice of Disclosures. The Authorized Institution shall promptly notify the ISO, and the ISO 
shall promptly notify any Affected Governance Participant, of any inadvertent or intentional release or 
possible release of the Confidential Market Information provided pursuant to this Agreement.  
The Authorized Institution shall take all steps to minimize any further release of Confidential Market 
Information, and shall take reasonable steps to attempt to retrieve any Confidential Market Information 
that may have been released.  
 
2.4  
Ownership and Privilege. Nothing in this Agreement, or incident to the provision of 
Confidential Market Information to the Authorized Institution pursuant to any Information Request, is 
intended, nor shall it be deemed, to be a waiver or abandonment of any legal privilege that may be 
asserted against, subsequent disclosure or discovery in any formal proceeding or investigation. Moreover, 
no transfer or creation of ownership rights in any intellectual property comprising Confidential Market 
Information is intended or shall be inferred by the disclosure of Confidential Market Information by the 
ISO, and any and all intellectual property comprising Confidential Market Information disclosed and any 
derivations thereof shall continue to be the exclusive intellectual property of the ISO and/or the Affected 
Governance Participant.  
 
3.  
Remedies.  
 
3.1  
Material Breach. The Authorized Institution agrees that any release of Confidential Market 
Information to persons not authorized to receive it or any publication of any material related to or that 
relies upon the Confidential Market Information which is not (i) approved in writing by the ISO prior to 
publication and (ii) redacted or summarized in such a manner that the Confidential Market Information 
may not be identified shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and may cause irreparable harm to the 
ISO and/or the Affected Governance Participant. In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the 
Authorized Institution, the ISO may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Authorized 
Institution, and all rights of the Authorized Institution hereunder shall thereupon terminate; provided, 
however, that the ISO may restore status as an Authorized Institution after consulting with the Affected 
Governance Participant and to the extent that: (i) the ISO determines that the disclosure was not due to the 
intentional, reckless or negligent action or omission of the Authorized Institution; (ii) there were no harm 
or damages suffered by the Affected Governance Participant; or (iii) similar good cause shown. 
 
Effective Date: 7/26/24 - Docket No. ER24-138-000 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Authorized Institution hereby shall indemnify, save, hold harmless, 
discharge, and release the ISO and each affected Governance Participant from and against any and all 
payments, liabilities, damages, losses or costs and expenses paid or directly incurred by the ISO and/or 
each affected Governance Participant arising from, based upon, related to, or associated with the breach 
of, or failure to perform or satisfy, any obligation of the Authorized Institution set forth in this 
Agreement.  
 
3.2  
Judicial Recourse. In the event of any breach of this Agreement, the ISO, the Affected 
Governance Participant and/or the Participants Committee shall have the right to seek and obtain at least 
the following types of relief: (a) temporary, preliminary, and/or permanent injunctive relief with respect 
to any breach and (b) the immediate return of all Confidential Market Information to the ISO. The 
Authorized Institution expressly agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, any relief sought 
properly includes, but shall not be limited to, the immediate return of all Confidential Market Information 
to the ISO.
